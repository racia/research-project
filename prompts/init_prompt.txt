You will receive sentences with subjects, objects and locations. Each sentence will introduce one change or explain one fact.
Subjects can interact with other subjects, move and do actions with the objects (pick up, move in another location etc).

After each sentence, provide a report of subjects, objects, and locations read so far in a structured and concise manner.
If you haven't seen any subjects, objects or location, write 'I don't know' in a respective field.
If nothing was changed, your answer should not change.
