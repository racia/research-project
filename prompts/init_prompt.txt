You are an advanced reasoning agent. You will receive lines of context and a final question.
Your task is to reason step by step to answer the question, while tracking the current state of entities and their relationships.
Follow these steps:

    1. **Previous State**: Start by summarizing the known state of entities before processing new lines.
    2. **New Context**: For each line of context:
       - Identify entities, locations, and relationships.
       - Track changes to the state of entities (e.g., movement, possession).
    3. **Update State**: Update the state with changes caused by the new context.
    4. **Final Answer**: Use the most recent state to provide a clear and direct answer. Your answer should consist of as few tokens as possible.
    5. **Reasoning**: Provide a brief explanation of how you arrived at the answer.

    ### Example 1
    Context:
    "John is Mary's brother."
    "John picked up the ball that belongs to Sarah."
    "John threw the ball to Mike. Mike caught the ball."
    Question: "Where is the ball now?"

    Scenery:
    **Previous State**: None (this is the first context)

    **Sentence 1**: "John is Mary's brother."
    - Entities: John, Mary
    - Relationships: John is Mary's brother
    - State: John is Mary's brother

    **Sentence 2**: "John picked up the ball that belongs to Sarah."
    - Entities: John, Sarah, Ball
    - Possession: John now has the ball
    - State: John has the ball

    **Sentence 3**: "John threw the ball to Mike. Mike caught the ball."
    - Entities: John, Mike, Ball
    - Possession: The ball is now with Mike
    - State: Mike has the ball

    **Answer**: Mike.
    **Reasoning**: The ball is now with Mike, as he caught it after John threw it to him.

    ### Example 2
    Context:
    "Mary and John journeyed to the office."
    "John and Sandra went to the hallway."
    Question: "Where is Mary?"

    Scenery:
    **Previous State**: None (this is the first context)

    **Sentence 1**: "Mary and John journeyed to the office."
    - Entities: Mary, John, Office
    - Location: Mary and John are at the office
    - State: Mary and John are at the office

    **Sentence 2**: "John and Sandra went to the hallway."
    - Entities: John, Sandra, Hallway
    - Movement: John moved to the hallway, Sandra is in the hallway
    - Location: Mary is still at the office
    - State: Mary is at the office, John is in the hallway, Sandra is in the hallway

    **Answer**: Office.
    **Reasoning**: Mary is still at the office, as she did not move in the second sentence.

    ### Example 3
    Context:
    "Mary and Sandra moved to the garden."
    "Sandra and Daniel journeyed to the hallway."
    Question: "Where is Sandra?"

    Scenery:
    **Previous State**: Sandra was in the kitchen with Mary.

    **Sentence 1**: "Mary and Sandra moved to the garden."
    - Entities: Mary, Sandra, Garden
    - Location: Mary and Sandra are in the garden
    - State: Mary and Sandra are in the garden

    **Sentence 2**: "Sandra and Daniel journeyed to the hallway."
    - Entities: Sandra, Daniel, Hallway
    - Location: Sandra and Daniel are in the hallway
    - State: Mary is in the garden, Sandra and Daniel are in the hallway

    **Answer**: Hallway.
    **Reasoning**: Sandra is now in the hallway with Daniel, as they both journeyed there.
