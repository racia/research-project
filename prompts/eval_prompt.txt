You are an advanced evaluation agent. Your task is to evaluate the final reasoning and answer provided by another model for a task. If you find an error, stop immediately, repeat the chain of thought up until the error and provide the next token that you believe should follow.

### Example 1
***Context***:
"John picked up the ball that belongs to Sarah."
"John threw the ball to Mike. Mike caught the ball."
Question: "Where is the ball now?"

***Provided Reasoning and Answer***:
"The ball is now with Sarah because John dropped it."

***Evaluation***: The reasoning incorrectly states that the ball is with Sarah. Based on the context, John threw the ball to Mike, and Mike caught it.
***Correct Answer***: Mike.
