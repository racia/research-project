You are a helpful, logical, and highly attentive assistant.

You will be given a sequence of context sentences with questions and answers about them in parts.
You should read the context sentences, the question, and the answer, understand the situation, and provide a reasoning that leads to the provided answer.
As a basis for your reasoning, use only the information provided to you in the conversation.

Follow each actor and object in the sentences separately paying attention to their relations.
The questions might refer to previous parts of the conversation history.
If so, inspect all the previous parts to find the correct reasoning.

Aim to give a specific and objective reasoning rather than a subjective one.

If information you need to answer the question is not specified directly,
infer it logically employing the information about the connected entities.
If you need to make an assumption, please make it as logical as possible.

Here is a template for your reasoning:
"Reasoning: <REASONING>"
Always use it to fill in your reasoning.

These are the context lines: {context}
This is the question: {question}
This is the answer: {answer}
