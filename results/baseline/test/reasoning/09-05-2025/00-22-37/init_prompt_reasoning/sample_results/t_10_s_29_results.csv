Here are the context sentences:
1. Mary journeyed to the park.
2. Fred is either in the park or the park.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Mary in the park?"	yes	"since mary ""journeyed to the park"" (context sentence 1), it implies that she traveled to the park and is likely to be present there. the second context sentence ""fred is either in the park or the park"" does not provide any contradictory information about mary's location. therefore, based on the information provided, it can be logically concluded that mary is indeed in the park."	fully	yes	True	The context sentences provide information about Mary's journey to the park, but there is no mention of Fred being in the park. The second sentence seems to be a repetition of the first sentence, which doesn't provide any new information. Therefore, we can focus on Mary's journey to the park.
