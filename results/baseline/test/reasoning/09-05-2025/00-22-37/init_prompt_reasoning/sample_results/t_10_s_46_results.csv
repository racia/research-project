Here are the context sentences:
1. Mary journeyed to the office.
2. Bill is either in the school or the kitchen.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the school?"	maybe	"the context sentences do not provide a direct statement about bill's location being specifically in the school. the second sentence only narrows down bill's possible locations to two options: the school or the kitchen. since there is no additional information to confirm or rule out either option, the answer is ""maybe"", indicating uncertainty about bill's presence in the school."	fully	maybe	True	The question asks about Bill's location, and we know that Bill is either in the school or the kitchen. Since Mary journeyed to the office, there is no information about Bill's location in the office. Therefore, we can infer that Bill's location is either in the school or the kitchen.

Here are the context sentences:
4. Mary journeyed to the cinema.
5. Julie is in the cinema.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Mary in the cinema?"	yes	the context sentence 4 states that mary journeyed to the cinema, which implies that mary's destination was the cinema. it is logical to assume that mary arrived at her destination, and therefore, she is in the cinema. this assumption is further supported by the fact that julie is also in the cinema, as stated in sentence 5, which suggests that the cinema is a valid location where people can be present.	fully	yes	True	We know that Mary journeyed to the cinema, which implies that she arrived at the cinema. Additionally, Julie is already in the cinema. Since Mary arrived at the cinema, it is likely that she is also in the cinema.

Here are the context sentences:
7. Bill travelled to the cinema.
8. Bill is either in the kitchen or the school.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the cinema?"	no	"sentence 7 states that bill travelled to the cinema, but sentence 8 contradicts this by stating that bill is either in the kitchen or the school, with no mention of the cinema. this implies that bill's travel to the cinema (sentence 7) did not result in him being in the cinema, and instead, he must be in one of the two locations mentioned in sentence 8 (kitchen or school). therefore, the answer is ""no"", bill is not in"	fully	yes	False	We know that Bill travelled to the cinema, which implies that he arrived at the cinema.

10. Bill is in the cinema.
11. Bill is either in the school or the park.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the office?"	no	"sentence 10 states that bill is in the cinema, which implies that bill's location is the cinema. sentence 11 provides alternative locations for bill, but neither of them is the office. since there is no mention of the office as a possible location for bill, and bill is already confirmed to be in the cinema, the answer is ""no"", bill is not in the office."	fully	no	True	We know that Bill is in the cinema (from sentence 10), and we also know that he is either in the school or the park (from sentence 11). However, there is no information about Bill being in the office. Therefore, we can conclude that Bill is not in the office.
