Here are the context sentences:
1. Fred moved to the school.
2. Bill is either in the park or the cinema.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the park?"	maybe	"the context sentences do not provide a definitive location for bill, only stating that he is either in the park or the cinema. there is no information that suggests bill is definitely in the park, and there is also no information that suggests he is not in the park. therefore, the most logical answer is ""maybe"", as we cannot determine his exact location with certainty based on the provided information."	fully	maybe	True	The question asks about Bill's location, and we know that Bill is either in the park or the cinema. Since Fred moved to the school, there is no information that suggests Bill is in the school. Therefore, we need to consider the remaining options, which are the park and the cinema.

Here are the context sentences:
4. Bill moved to the bedroom.
5. Mary went back to the school.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the park?"	no	the context sentences do not provide any direct information about bill's current location being in the park. in fact, sentence 4 states that bill moved to the bedroom, which implies that bill is currently in the bedroom, not in the park. additionally, sentence 2 from the previous part of the conversation mentioned that bill was either in the park or the cinema, but since then, bill has moved to the bedroom, so it can be inferred that bill is no longer in the park.	fully	no	True	We know that Bill moved to the bedroom (sentence 4), which means he is not in the park. Additionally, there is no information that suggests Bill is in the school, as Mary went back to the school (sentence 5). Therefore, we can conclude that Bill is not in the park.

7. Bill is in the cinema.
8. Julie moved to the office.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the cinema?"	yes	"sentence 7 directly states that bill is in the cinema, which explicitly answers the question. there is no conflicting or contradictory information in the context sentences, and sentence 8 only provides information about julie's location, which does not affect bill's location. therefore, the answer is indeed ""yes"", bill is in the cinema."	fully	yes	True	The question asks about Bill's location, and we know that Bill is in the cinema (sentence 7).

11. Bill moved to the kitchen.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the bedroom?"	no	"sentence 10 provides a possible location for bill, either in the bedroom or the park. however, sentence 11 updates bill's location, stating that bill moved to the kitchen. this implies that bill is no longer in either the bedroom or the park, but has moved to a new location, the kitchen. therefore, the answer is ""no"", bill is not in the bedroom."	fully	no	True	We know that Bill is either in the bedroom or the park (sentence 10), but then Bill moved to the kitchen (sentence 11).
