1. Bill is either in the office or the kitchen.
2. Julie went to the school.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the office?"	maybe	"the context only provides two possible locations for bill: the office or the kitchen. there is no information that confirms or denies bill's presence in the office. therefore, it is uncertain whether bill is in the office, and the answer is ""maybe"". the information about julie going to the school is irrelevant to bill's location."	fully	maybe	True	The question asks about Bill's location, and we know from sentence 1 that Bill is either in the office or the kitchen.
