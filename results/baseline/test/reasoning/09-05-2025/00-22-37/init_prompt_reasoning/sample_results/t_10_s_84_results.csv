Here are the context sentences:
4. Fred is in the park.
5. Fred moved to the kitchen.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Fred in the office?"	no	the context sentences do not mention fred being in the office. in fact, they mention fred being in the park initially and then moving to the kitchen, but there is no mention of the office. therefore, based on the provided information, it can be logically concluded that fred is not in the office.	fully	no	True	We have two statements about Fred's location: one saying he's in the park (sentence 4) and another saying he moved to the kitchen (sentence 5).

8. Fred is either in the office or the office.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Fred in the office?"	maybe	"the context sentence ""8. fred is either in the office or the office"" is a tautology, meaning it does not provide any new information about fred's location. it simply states that fred is in the office or in the office, which is a redundant and unclear statement. therefore, based on the provided information, it cannot be determined with certainty whether fred is in the office or not, hence the answer ""maybe""."	fully	cannot be determined (due to the contradictory statement)	False	Sentence 8 states that Fred is either in the office or the office. This is a contradictory statement, as it implies Fred is in the office, but also in the office, which is not possible. We can infer that this sentence is incorrect or incomplete.
