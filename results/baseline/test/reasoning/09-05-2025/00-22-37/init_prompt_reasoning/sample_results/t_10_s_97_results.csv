Here are the context sentences:
1. Bill went back to the kitchen.
2. Bill is in the office.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the office?"	yes	the context sentences provide two separate statements about bill's location. sentence 1 states that bill went back to the kitchen, but sentence 2 explicitly states that bill is in the office. since sentence 2 is a more recent and direct statement about bill's current location, it takes precedence over sentence 1. therefore, the correct answer is yes, bill is in the office.	fully	yes	True	The question asks about Bill's current location, and we have two sentences that provide information about his location. Sentence 1 states that Bill went back to the kitchen, which implies that he was previously somewhere else. Sentence 2 states that Bill is in the office, which suggests that his current location is the office.
