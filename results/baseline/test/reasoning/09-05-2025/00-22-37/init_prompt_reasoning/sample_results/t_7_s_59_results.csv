How many objects is Mary carrying?"	one	from the context sentences, we can see that mary travelled to different locations (bedroom, bathroom) and finally got the milk in one of those locations (sentence 7). there is no mention of mary putting down the milk or giving it to someone else. therefore, it is logical to assume that mary is still carrying the milk, which is one object.	fully	one	True	Mary got the milk there, which implies that she obtained the milk in a specific location. Since she got the milk in the office (from sentence 7), it is likely that she is carrying the milk. Additionally, there is no mention of her dropping or giving away the milk, so it can be inferred that she is still carrying it.
