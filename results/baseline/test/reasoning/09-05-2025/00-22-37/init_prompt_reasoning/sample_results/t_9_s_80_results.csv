1. Sandra went to the bathroom.
2. Sandra is in the office.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Sandra in the office?"	yes	"the context sentence ""sandra is in the office"" directly states that sandra is in the office. the first sentence ""sandra went to the bathroom"" does not contradict this statement, as it does not imply that she left the office, but rather that she went to the bathroom, which is likely a part of the office. therefore, based on the provided information, it can be concluded that sandra is indeed in the office."	fully	yes	True	The question asks about Sandra's location, and we have two context sentences that provide information about her location. Sentence 1 states that Sandra went to the bathroom, which implies that she was not in the office at that time.
