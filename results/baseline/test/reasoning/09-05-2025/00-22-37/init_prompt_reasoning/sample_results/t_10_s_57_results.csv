7. Bill is either in the bedroom or the cinema.
8. Julie moved to the bedroom.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the cinema?"	maybe	"the context sentence ""bill is either in the bedroom or the cinema"" indicates that bill's location is limited to two possibilities: the bedroom or the cinema. the subsequent sentence ""julie moved to the bedroom"" does not provide any direct information about bill's location. since bill could be in either the bedroom or the cinema, and julie's movement to the bedroom does not affect bill's location, we cannot conclude that bill is definitely in the cinema. therefore, the answer ""maybe"""	fully	yes	False	According to sentence 7, Bill is either in the bedroom or the cinema.
