Here are the context sentences:
1. Julie moved to the kitchen.
2. Fred is either in the bedroom or the bedroom.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Fred in the cinema?"	no	the context sentences do not mention the cinema at all, and the second sentence only mentions the bedroom as a possible location for fred. there is no information provided that would suggest fred is in the cinema. therefore, based on the given information, it can be logically concluded that fred is not in the cinema.	fully	no	True	The question asks about Fred's location, and the context sentences provide information about Fred's possible locations. Sentence 2 states that Fred is either in the bedroom or the bedroom, which seems to be a contradiction. However, we can infer that the sentence is trying to convey that Fred is in the bedroom. There is no mention of Fred being in the cinema.		"Reasoning: The question asks about Fred's location, and the context sentences provide information about Fred's possible locations.

Here are the context sentences:
7. Fred is in the kitchen.
8. Fred is in the school.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Fred in the school?"	yes	"the context sentence 8 explicitly states ""fred is in the school"", which directly answers the question ""is fred in the school?"" with a ""yes"". the fact that sentence 7 mentions fred being in the kitchen does not contradict this information, as it is possible for fred to be in multiple locations (although this might be unlikely in a real-world scenario). however, based on the provided information, we can conclude that fred is indeed in the school."	fully	yes	True	The question asks about Fred's location, and the context sentences provide two contradictory statements. Sentence 7 states that Fred is in the kitchen, while Sentence 8 states that Fred is in the school. Since both statements cannot be true, we can infer that Fred is actually in one of these locations, but the correct one is not specified.
