Here are the context sentences:
1. Mary is in the park.
2. Julie is either in the school or the office.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Julie in the school?"	maybe	"the context sentences provide information about mary's location, which is the park, but do not give a definitive answer about julie's location. the second sentence states that julie is either in the school or the office, but it does not specify which one. therefore, based on the available information, it is uncertain whether julie is in the school or not, hence the answer ""maybe""."	fully	maybe	True	The question asks about Julie's location, and we know that Julie is either in the school or the office. Since we are asked specifically about the school, we cannot conclude that Julie is in the office. Therefore, we need to consider the possibility that Julie is in the school.
