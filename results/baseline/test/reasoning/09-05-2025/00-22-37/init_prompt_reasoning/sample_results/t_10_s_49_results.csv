Here are the context sentences:
1. Julie travelled to the kitchen.
2. Julie is in the office.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Julie in the office?"	yes	the context sentences provide conflicting information about julie's location. sentence 1 states that julie travelled to the kitchen, implying that she was not in the kitchen initially. sentence 2, however, explicitly states that julie is in the office. since the question asks about julie's current location, we should rely on the more recent and explicit information provided in sentence 2, which confirms that julie is indeed in the office.	fully	yes	True	The question asks about Julie's current location, and we have two sentences that provide information about her movements. Sentence 1 states that Julie travelled to the kitchen, which implies that she was not in the kitchen initially. Sentence 2 states that Julie is in the office, which suggests that she arrived at the office after her travel to the kitchen.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Mary in the office?"	yes	sentence 4 explicitly states that mary journeyed to the office, which implies that she is now in the office. the information about fred's location in sentence 5 is irrelevant to mary's location, so we can ignore it. therefore, based on sentence 4, we can conclude that mary is indeed in the office.	fully	yes	True	The question asks about Mary's current location, and we have one sentence that provides information about her movement.

7. Mary is in the bedroom.
8. Fred went to the bedroom.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Mary in the bedroom?"	yes	sentence 7 explicitly states that mary is in the bedroom, which directly answers the question. the additional information in sentence 8 about fred going to the bedroom does not change mary's location, so we can conclude that mary is indeed in the bedroom.	fully	yes	True	The question asks about Mary's current location, and we have one sentence that provides information about her location.
