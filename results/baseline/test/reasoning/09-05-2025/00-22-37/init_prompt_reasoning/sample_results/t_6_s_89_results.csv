Here are the context sentences:
1. John went back to the office.
2. John went back to the bathroom.

Now, answer the following question:
Is John in the bathroom?"	yes	the context sentences indicate that john went back to the office (sentence 1) and then went back to the bathroom (sentence 2). since john went back to the bathroom after going to the office, it can be inferred that john is currently in the bathroom. the sequence of events suggests that john's most recent location is the bathroom, which leads to the conclusion that john is indeed in the bathroom.	fully	yes	True	The question asks about John's current location, and we have two sentences that describe John's movements. Sentence 1 states that John went back to the office, which implies that he was previously somewhere else. Sentence 2 states that John went back to the bathroom, which implies that he was previously in the office (since he went back to the bathroom).
