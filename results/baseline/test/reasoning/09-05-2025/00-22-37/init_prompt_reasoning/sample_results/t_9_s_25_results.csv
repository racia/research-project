2. Daniel is in the kitchen.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Daniel in the hallway?"	no	the context sentences provide information about the locations of two individuals, sandra and daniel. sentence 1 states that sandra travelled to the office, which does not provide any information about daniel's location. sentence 2 explicitly states that daniel is in the kitchen. there is no mention of the hallway in either sentence. therefore, based on the provided information, it can be logically concluded that daniel is not in the hallway, as his location is specified to be the kitchen.	fully	no	True	The question asks about Daniel's location, and we know from sentence 2 that Daniel is in the kitchen.
