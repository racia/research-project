8. Fred is in the park.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Fred in the park?"	yes	sentence 8 explicitly states that fred is in the park, which directly answers the question. the fact that sentence 7 also states that fred is in the cinema does not contradict this, as it is possible for fred to be in both locations (although this would be a contradictory statement, it is not explicitly stated that fred can only be in one location). however, since sentence 8 clearly states that fred is in the park, the answer is yes.	fully	yes	True	According to sentence 8, Fred is indeed in the park.
