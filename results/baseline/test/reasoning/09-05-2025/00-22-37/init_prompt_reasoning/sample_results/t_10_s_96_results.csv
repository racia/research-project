7. Mary is either in the park or the bedroom.
8. Fred moved to the cinema.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Mary in the bedroom?"	maybe	"the context sentence 7 states that mary is either in the park or the bedroom, which means we have two possible locations for mary. there is no additional information provided that would allow us to eliminate one of these options, so we cannot conclude that mary is definitely in the bedroom. the information about fred moving to the cinema (context sentence 8) is irrelevant to mary's location. therefore, the most logical answer is ""maybe"", as we cannot determine mary's exact location with certainty"	fully	maybe	True	According to sentence 7, Mary is either in the park or the bedroom, but it does not specify which one.
