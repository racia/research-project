Here are the context sentences:
1. Fred is in the bedroom.
2. Fred is in the school.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Fred in the school?"	yes	"the context sentences provide two separate statements about fred's location. sentence 1 states that fred is in the bedroom, but sentence 2 states that fred is in the school. since sentence 2 is the most recent and direct statement about fred's location, it takes precedence over sentence 1. therefore, based on sentence 2, we can conclude that fred is indeed in the school, which aligns with the provided answer ""yes""."	fully	yes	True	The question asks about Fred's location, and we have two context sentences that provide information about Fred's location. Sentence 1 states that Fred is in the bedroom, and sentence 2 states that Fred is in the school. Since both sentences provide contradictory information, we need to consider the context and the relationships between the entities.
