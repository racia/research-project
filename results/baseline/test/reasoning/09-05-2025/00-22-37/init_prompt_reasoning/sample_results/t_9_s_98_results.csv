2. Daniel went to the garden.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Daniel in the bedroom?"	no	there is no information provided about daniel being in the bedroom. the context only mentions daniel going to the garden, which implies that he is in the garden, not in the bedroom. additionally, there is no connection between the bedroom and the hallway, where mary is no longer present, which does not provide any information about daniel's location. therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that daniel is not in the bedroom.	fully	unknown	False	Since Daniel went to the garden, there is no direct information about his current location.
