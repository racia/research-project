7. Julie is either in the bedroom or the office.
8. Fred is in the park.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Julie in the bedroom?"	maybe	"the context sentence 7 states that julie is either in the bedroom or the office, which means julie's location is uncertain and could be either of the two options. there is no additional information that would allow us to determine julie's exact location, so the answer is ""maybe"", indicating that julie might be in the bedroom, but it's not certain."	fully	yes	False	The question asks about Julie's location, and we know from sentence 7 that Julie is either in the bedroom or the office.

Is Julie in the school?"	yes	"context sentence 14 explicitly states that ""julie is in the school"", which directly answers the question and confirms that julie is indeed in the school. the previous context sentence 13, which mentioned julie being either in the kitchen or the bedroom, is contradicted by this new information, and can be disregarded."	fully	yes	True	The question asks about Julie's location, and we know from sentence 14 that Julie is indeed in the school.
