Here are the context sentences:
1. Mary moved to the office.
2. Mary is in the bathroom.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Mary in the hallway?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that mary moved to the office (sentence 1) and is currently in the bathroom (sentence 2). there is no mention of mary being in the hallway. since mary is already in a specific location (the bathroom), it is logical to conclude that she is not in the hallway.	fully	no	True	The question asks about Mary's location, and we have two context sentences that provide information about her location. Sentence 1 states that Mary moved to the office, which implies that she was previously somewhere else. Sentence 2 states that Mary is currently in the bathroom. Since Mary moved to the bathroom, it's unlikely that she is in the hallway.
