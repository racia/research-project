Here are the context sentences:
1. Fred is either in the bedroom or the bedroom.
2. Fred is in the kitchen.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Fred in the kitchen?"	yes	"from context sentence 2, ""fred is in the kitchen"", we can directly infer that fred is indeed in the kitchen. this sentence explicitly states fred's location, which answers the question. the first context sentence, ""fred is either in the bedroom or the bedroom"", is redundant and does not provide any additional information that contradicts or supports the fact that fred is in the kitchen."	fully	yes	True	The question asks about Fred's location, and we have two statements about Fred's location. Statement 1 says Fred is either in the bedroom or the bedroom, which seems redundant and unclear. Statement 2 explicitly states that Fred is in the kitchen. Since there is no contradictory information, we can conclude that Fred's location is indeed in the kitchen.
