Now, answer the following question:
Is Mary in the park?"	yes	"since the context sentence ""mary travelled to the park"" explicitly states that mary went to the park, it can be logically concluded that mary is indeed in the park. the sentence does not provide any information about mary leaving the park, so it is reasonable to assume that she is still there. the information about bill's location is irrelevant to mary's location, so it does not affect the conclusion."	fully	yes	True	The question asks about Mary's location, and we know from sentence 2 that Mary travelled to the park.
