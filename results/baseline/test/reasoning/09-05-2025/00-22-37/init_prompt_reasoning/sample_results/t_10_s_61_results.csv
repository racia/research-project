Here are the context sentences:
1. Mary moved to the kitchen.
2. Mary is in the park.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Mary in the park?"	yes	"the context sentences provide two separate statements about mary's location. sentence 1 states that mary moved to the kitchen, but sentence 2 explicitly states that mary is in the park. since sentence 2 is the most recent and direct statement about mary's location, it takes precedence over sentence 1. therefore, the answer to the question ""is mary in the park?"" is indeed ""yes""."	fully	yes	True	The context sentences provide information about Mary's location. Sentence 1 states that Mary moved to the kitchen, which implies that she was not in the park at that time. However, sentence 2 states that Mary is currently in the park. This information is more recent and takes precedence over the earlier information.		"Reasoning: The context sentences provide information about Mary's location.
