Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
mention
Sandra
's
location
at
all
.
They
only
provide
information
about
Mary
's
location
,
stating
that
she
is
not
in
the
kitchen
and
is
no
longer
in
the
bedroom
.
Since
there
is
no
mention
of
Sandra
,
we
cannot
determine
her
location
in
the
office
or
anywhere
else
.
Answer
