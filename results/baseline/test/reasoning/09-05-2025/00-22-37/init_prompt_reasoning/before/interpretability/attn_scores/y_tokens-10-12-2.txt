Reason
ing
:
Sentence

4
states
that
Fred
travelled
to
the
cinema
,
which
implies
that
he
is
currently
in
the
cinema
.
There
is
no
information
provided
about
Fred
's
location
before
he
travelled
to
the
cinema
,
so
we
cannot
infer
that
he
was
in
the
school
.
Additionally
,
sentence

5
does
not
mention
Fred
at
all
,
so
we
cannot
use
that
information
to
answer
the
question
.

no
