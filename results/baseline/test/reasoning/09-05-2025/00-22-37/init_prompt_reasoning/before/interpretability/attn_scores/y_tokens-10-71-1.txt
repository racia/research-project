Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Bill
's
location
,
and
we
know
that
Bill
is
either
in
the
bedroom
or
the
office
.
Since
Fred
went
back
to
the
office
,
it
doesn
't
provide
information
about
Bill
's
location
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
consider
the
initial
information
about
Bill
's
location
.
Answer
:
yes
