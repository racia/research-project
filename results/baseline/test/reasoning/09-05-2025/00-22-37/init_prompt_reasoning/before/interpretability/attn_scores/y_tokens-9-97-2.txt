Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
in
the
garden
,
but
the
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
information
about
Mary
's
location
.
The
sentences
only
mention
Daniel
's
movement
to
the
bathroom
and
John
's
movement
to
the
hallway
,
but
do
not
mention
Mary
at
all
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
conclude
anything
about
Mary
's
location
in
the
garden
.
