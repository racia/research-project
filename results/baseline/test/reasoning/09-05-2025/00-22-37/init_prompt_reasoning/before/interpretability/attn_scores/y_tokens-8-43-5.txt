Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
what
Mary
is
carrying
.
We
need
to
find
the
last
action
Mary
performed
,
which
is
disc
arding
the
apple
(
sentence

22
).
This
action
implies
that
Mary
was
carrying
the
apple
,
but
now
she
has
discarded
it
.
Since
Mary
has
not
picked
up
anything
else
,
she
is
not
carrying
anything
.
Answer
:
nothing
