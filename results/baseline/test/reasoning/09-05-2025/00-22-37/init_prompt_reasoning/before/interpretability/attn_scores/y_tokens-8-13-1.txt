Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
what
Mary
is
carrying
.
Mary
took
the
milk
there
,
which
means
she
took
the
milk
to
a
specific
location
.
Since
John
moved
to
the
garden
,
Sandra
went
to
the
office
,
and
Daniel
moved
to
the
bathroom
,
it
is
likely
that
Mary
took
the
milk
to
one
of
these
locations
.
The
only
location
where
Mary
took
the
milk
is
mentioned
is
"
there
",
which
is
not
a
specific
location
.
However
,
based
on
the
context
,
it
is
likely
that
Mary
took
the
milk
to
the
bathroom
,
where
Daniel
moved
.
