Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
current
location
,
and
we
have
two
context
sentences
that
provide
information
about
her
location
.
Sentence

8
states
that
Mary
is
in
the
bedroom
,
which
implies
that
she
is
currently
in
the
bedroom
.
There
is
no
information
about
Mary
's
location
in
the
garden
,
so
we
can
't
determine
if
she
is
in
the
garden
or
not
.
Answer
:
no
