Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
Bill
moved
to
the
park
,
which
means
Bill
was
not
in
the
park
initially
.
However
,
the
next
sentence
states
that
Bill
is
in
the
bedroom
,
which
contrad
icts
the
initial
movement
to
the
park
.
This
inconsistency
implies
that
the
information
is
incorrect
,
and
we
cannot
determine
Bill
's
location
in
the
kitchen
.
