Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Fred
's
location
,
and
we
have
two
context
sentences
that
provide
information
about
his
location
.
Sentence

10
states
that
Fred
is
either
in
the
kitchen
or
the
office
,
but
it
does
not
specify
which
one
.
Since
Mary
's
location
is
mentioned
in
sentence

11
,
but
it
does
not
relate
to
Fred
's
location
,
we
can
focus
on
the
information
provided
about
Fred
.
Since
Fred
's
location
is
not
specified
,
we
cannot
determine
whether
he
is
in
the
kitchen
or
not
.
