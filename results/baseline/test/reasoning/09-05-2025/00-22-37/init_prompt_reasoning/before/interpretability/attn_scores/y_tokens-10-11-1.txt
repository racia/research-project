Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Fred
's
location
,
and
the
context
sentences
provide
information
about
Fred
's
possible
locations
.
Sentence

2
states
that
Fred
is
either
in
the
bedroom
or
the
bedroom
,
which
seems
to
be
a
contradiction
.

,
we
can
infer
that
the

trying
to
convey
that
Fred
is
in
the
bedroom
.
There
is
no
mention
of
Fred
being
in
the
cinema
.
Answer
:
no
