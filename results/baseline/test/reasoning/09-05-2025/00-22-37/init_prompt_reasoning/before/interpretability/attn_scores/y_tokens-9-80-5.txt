Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
John
's
current
location
,
and
we
have
two
context
sentences
that
provide
information
about
his
movements
.
Sentence

14
states
that
John
went
to
the
bedroom
,
which
implies
that
he
was
in
the
bedroom
at
some
point
.
Sentence

13
states
that
John
is
no
longer
in
the
bedroom
,
which
suggests
that
he
is
not
currently
in
the
bedroom
.
However
,
there
is
no
information
about
John
's
location
in
the
bathroom
,
so
we
can
't
determine
if
he
is
in
the
bathroom
or
not
.
Answer
:
not
mentioned
