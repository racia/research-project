Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Fred
's
location
,
and
the
context
sentences
provide
two
contradictory
statements
.
Sentence

7
states
that
Fred
is
in
the
kitchen
,
while
Sentence

8
states
that
Fred
is
in
the
school
.
Since
both
statements
cannot
be
true
,
we
can
infer
that
Fred
is
actually
in
one
of
these
locations
,
but
the
correct
one
is
not
specified
.
Answer
:
yes
