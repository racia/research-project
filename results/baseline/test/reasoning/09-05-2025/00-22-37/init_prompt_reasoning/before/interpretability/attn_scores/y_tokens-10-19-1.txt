Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Fred
's
location
,
and
we
have
two
statements
about
Fred
's
location
.
Statement

1
says
Fred
is
either
in
the
bedroom
or
the
bedroom
,
which
seems
redundant
and
unclear
.
Statement

2
explicitly
states
that
Fred
is
in
the
kitchen
.
Since
there
is
no
contradictory
information
,
we
can
conclude
that
Fred
's
location
is
indeed
in
the
kitchen
.
Answer
:
yes
