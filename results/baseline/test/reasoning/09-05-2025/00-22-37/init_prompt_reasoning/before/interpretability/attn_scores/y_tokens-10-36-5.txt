Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
information
about
Mary
's
current
location
,
but
we
know
she
was
in
the
office
(
from
sentence

Since
there
is
no
contradictory
information
,
we
can
assume
she
is
not
in
the
school
.
However
,
we
don
't
have
any
information
about
her
current
location
,
so
we
can
't
confirm
where
she
is
.
