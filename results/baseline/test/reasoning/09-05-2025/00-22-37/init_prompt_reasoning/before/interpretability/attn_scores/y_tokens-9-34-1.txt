Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
went
back
to
the
bedroom
(
sentence

1
),
it
implies
that
she
was
not
in
the
bedroom
initially
.
However
,
there
is
no
information
provided
about
Mary
's
location
before
going
back
to
the
bedroom
.
Additionally
,
sentence

2
states
that
Daniel
is
no
longer
in
the
hallway
,
which
does
not
provide
any
information
about
Mary
's
location
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
conclude
that
Mary
is
in
the
garden
or
any
other
location
.
