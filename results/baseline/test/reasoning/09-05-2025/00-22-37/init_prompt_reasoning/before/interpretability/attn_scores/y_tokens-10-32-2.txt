Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
,
and
we
have
two
context
sentences
that
provide
information
about
her
location
.
Sentence

4
states
that
Mary
is
either
in
the
school
or
the
cinema
,
but
it
does
not
specify
which
one
.
Sentence

5
does
not
mention
Mary
,
but
it
provides
information
about
Fred
's
location
.
Since
there
is
no
direct
information
about
Mary
's
location
,
we
cannot
determine
whether
she
is
in
the
office
or
not
.
Answer
:
not
mentioned
