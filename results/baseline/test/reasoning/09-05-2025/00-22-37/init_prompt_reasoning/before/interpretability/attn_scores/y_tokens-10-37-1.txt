Reason
ing
:
Mary
went
back
to
the
bedroom
,
which
implies
that
she
was
previously
somewhere
else
.
Since
Julie
is
currently
in
the
park
,
Mary
's
return
to
the
bedroom
suggests
that
she
is
not
in
the
park
.
Additionally
,
there
is
no
information
indicating
that
Mary
left
the
bedroom
,
so
it
is
likely
that
she
is
still
there
.
