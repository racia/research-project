Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
mention
John
picking
up
the
apple
and
moving
to
the
office
,
but
do
not
specify
where
these
actions
took
place
.
However
,
we
know
that
John
went
to
the
hallway
in
a
previous
context
(
sentence

8
).
Since
there
is
no
contradictory
information
,
we
can
assume
that
John
is
not
in
the
bathroom
,
as
he
is
now
in
the
office
.
Answer

no
