Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
what
John
is
carrying
.
We
need
to
find
the
last
action
John
performed
,
which
is
putting
down
the
football
(
sentence

13
).
This
action
implies
that
John
was
carrying
the
football
,
but
now
he
has
put
it
down
.
Since
John
has
not
picked
up
anything
else
,
he
is
not
carrying
anything
.
Answer
:
nothing
