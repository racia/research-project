Reason
ing
:
According
to
sentence

5
,
Sandra
went
back
to
the
hallway
,
which
implies
that
she
was
previously
in
the
bathroom
.
However
,
the
question
asks
if
Sandra
is
currently
in
the
bathroom
.
Since
sentence

5
only
mentions
her
going
back
to
the
hallway
,
it
does
not
provide
information
about
her
current
location
.
Answer

no
