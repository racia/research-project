ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Sandra
's
location
,
and
the
context
sentences
provide
information
about
Sandra
's
actions
.
Since
Sandra
got
and
grabbed
something
in
the
previous
sentences
,

implies
that
she
is
still
in
the
same
location
.

previous
context
,
Sandra
was
in
the
bedroom

Since
there
is
no
information

,
it
is
likely
that
Sandra
is
still
in
the
bedroom
.
