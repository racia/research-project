Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Bill
's
location
,
and
we
have
two
context
sentences
that
provide
information
about
his
location
.
Sentence

14
states
that
Bill
is
either
in
the
cinema
or
the
park
,
but
it
does
not
specify
which
one
.
Sentence

13
mentions
Mary
's
location
,
but
it
does
not
relate
to
Bill
's
location
.
Since
Bill
's
location
is
not
specified
,
we
cannot
determine
whether
he
is
in
the
cinema
or
not
.
