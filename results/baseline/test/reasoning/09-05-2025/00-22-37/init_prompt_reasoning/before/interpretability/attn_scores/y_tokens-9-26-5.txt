Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
,
and
we
have
two
context
sentences
that
provide
information
about
her
location
.
Sentence

13
states
that
Mary
is
not
in
the
hallway
,
and
Sentence

14
states
that
Mary
travelled
to
the
hallway
,
which
implies
that
she
is
currently
in
the
hallway
.
Since
the
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
in
the
kitchen
,
and
we
have
no
information
about
her
being
in
the
kitchen
,
we
can
conclude
that
she
is
not
in
the
kitchen
.
Answer
:
no
