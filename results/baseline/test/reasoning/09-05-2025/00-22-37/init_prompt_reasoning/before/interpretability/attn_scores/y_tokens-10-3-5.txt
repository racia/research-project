Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Julie
's
location
,
and
we
know
from
sentence

14
that
Julie
is
indeed
in
the
school
.
This
information
contrad
icts
sentence

13
,
which
stated
that
Julie
is
either
in
the
kitchen
or
the
bedroom
.
However
,
since
sentence

14
is
more
specific
and
recent
,
we
can
conclude
that
Julie
is
indeed
in
the
school
.
