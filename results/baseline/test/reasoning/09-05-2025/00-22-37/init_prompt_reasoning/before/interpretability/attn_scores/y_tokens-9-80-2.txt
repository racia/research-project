Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
current
location
,
and
we
have
two
context
sentences
that
provide
information
about
her
movements
.
Sentence

4
states
that
Mary
is
in
the
hallway
,
which
implies
that
she
was
in
the
hallway
at
some
point
.
Sentence

5
states
that
Mary
went
to
the
garden
,
which
suggests
that
she
moved
from
the
hallway
to
the
garden
.
However
,
the
question
asks
about
her
current
location
,
not
her
previous
location
.
Since
we
don
't
have
any
information
about
Mary
's
current
location
after
she
went
to
the
garden
,
we
can
't
determine
her
current
location
.
