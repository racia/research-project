Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Bill
's
location
,
and
we
know
from
sentence

2
that
Bill
travelled
to
the
park
.
There
is
no
information
about
Bill
's
location
after
arriving
at
the
park
,
nor
is
there
any
mention
of
Bill
being
in
the
bedroom
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
conclude
that
Bill
is
in
the
bedroom
.
Answer
:
No
