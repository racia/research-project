ing
:
The
question
asks
about
what
Daniel
is
carrying
.
Daniel
's
action
is
described
in
sentence

17
,
where
he

there
.
The
"
there
"
refers
to
the
location
mentioned
in
the
previous
sentences
,
which
is
not
specified
.
However
,
since

sentence

that
the
"
there
"
refers

the
bedroom

Therefore
,
Daniel
is
carrying
the
milk
.
