Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
Sandra
is
in
the
office
(
from
sentence

11
),
but
we
don
't
have
any
information
about
Sandra
's
previous
location
,
including
the
garden
.
Since
there
's
no
direct
connection
between
Sandra
's
current
location
and
the
garden
,
we
can
't
conclude
that
she
is
or
isn
't
in
the
garden
.
