Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
,
and
we
have
two
context
sentences
that
provide
information
about
her
location
.
Sentence

7
states
that
Mary
went
back
to
the
office
,
which
implies
that
she
was
previously
somewhere
else
,
but
it
does
not
specify
where
.
Sentence

8
mentions
Julie
's
location
,
but
it
does
not
mention
Mary
.
Since
there
is
no
direct
information
about
Mary
's
location
,
we
cannot
determine
whether
she
is
in
the
bedroom
or
not
.
Answer
:
not
mentioned
