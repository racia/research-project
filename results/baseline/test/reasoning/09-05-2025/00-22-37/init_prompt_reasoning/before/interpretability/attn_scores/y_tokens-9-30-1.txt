Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
in
the
garden
.
Since
sentence

2
states
that
Mary
is
"
no
longer
"
in
the
garden
,
it
implies
that
Mary
was
in
the
garden
at
some
point
but
is
not
there
now
.
This
information
,
combined
with
the
fact
that
sentence

1
does
not
mention
Mary
's
location
,
suggests
that
Mary
is
not
currently
in
the
garden
.
Answer
:
no
