Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
John
's
current
location
,
and
we
have
two
context
sentences
that
provide
information
about
his
movements
.
Sentence

10
states
that
John
travelled
to
the
office
,
which
implies
that
he
was
not
in
the
office
initially
.
Sentence

11
states
that
John
moved
to
the
bedroom
,
which
suggests
that
he
is
currently
in
the
bedroom
.
There
is
no
information
about
John
's
location
in
the
garden
,
so
we
can
't
determine
if
he
is
in
the
garden
or
not
.
Answer
:
no
