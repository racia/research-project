Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
what
Daniel
is
carrying
.
We
need
to
find
the
last
action
Daniel
performed
that
involved
carrying
something
.
In
sentence

9
,
Daniel
got
the
football
,
which
implies
that
he
is
carrying
it
.
However
,
in
sentence

10
,
it
is
mentioned
that
Daniel
went
to
the
kitchen
,
which
does
not
imply
that
he
is
carrying
anything
.
Therefore
,
we
can
conclude
that
Daniel
is
carrying
the
football
.
