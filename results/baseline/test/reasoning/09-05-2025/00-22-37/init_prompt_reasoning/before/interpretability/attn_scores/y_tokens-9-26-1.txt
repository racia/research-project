Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
,
and
we
have
two
context
sentences
that
provide
information
about
her
location
.
Sentence

1
states
that
Mary
moved
to
the
office
,
which
implies
that
she
was
previously
somewhere
else
.
Sentence

2
states
that
Mary
is
currently
in
the
bathroom
.
Since
Mary
moved
to
the
bathroom
,
it
's
unlikely
that
she
is
in
the
hallway
.
Answer
:
no
