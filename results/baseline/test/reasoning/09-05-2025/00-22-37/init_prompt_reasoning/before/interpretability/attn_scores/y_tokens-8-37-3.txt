ing
:
The
question
asks
about
what
John
is
carrying
,
and
there
is
no
sentence
that

John
carrying
something
.
The
only
sentence
that
mentions
John
is
sentence

3

which
states
that
John
took
the
football
there
,
but
it
doesn
't
imply
that
John
is
carrying
the
football
anymore
since
sentence

7
states
that
John
put
down
the
football
.
