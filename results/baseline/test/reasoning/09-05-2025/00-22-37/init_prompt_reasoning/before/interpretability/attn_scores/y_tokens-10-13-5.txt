Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
Bill
is
either
in
the
cinema
or
the
kitchen
(
sentence

13
),
but
then
it
's
mentioned
that
Bill
is
in
the
office
(
sentence

14
).
This
information
contrad
icts
the
initial
possibility
of
Bill
being
in
the
cinema
or
kitchen
.
Therefore
,
we
can
conclude
that
Bill
is
not
in
the
park
,
as
he
is
already
in
the
office
.
