Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
mention
Sandra
carrying
any
objects
until
sentence

18
,
where
it
is
mentioned
that
Sandra
took
the
football
there
.
However
,
this
sentence
does
not
specify
what
Sandra
is
carrying
,
only
that
she
took
the
football
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
the
exact
number
of
objects
Sandra
is
carrying
.
Answer

not
mentioned
