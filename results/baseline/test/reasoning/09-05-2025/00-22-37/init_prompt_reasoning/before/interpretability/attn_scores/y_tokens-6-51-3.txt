Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
(
7
)
and
(
8
)
mention
Mary
's
actions
,
but
they
don
't
specify
the
location
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Mary
is
not
in
the
garden
,
as
she
travelled
to
the
bedroom
.
There
is
no
information
that
suggests
Mary
is
in
the
bathroom
,
so
we
can
't
conclude
that
she
is
.
Answer
