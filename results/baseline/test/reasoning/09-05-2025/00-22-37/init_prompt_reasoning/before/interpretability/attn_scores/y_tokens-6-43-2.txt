Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
mention
Daniel
grabbing
the
milk
there
,
but
it
doesn
't
specify
where
"
there
"
is
.
However
,
Mary
grabbed
the
apple
there
,
which
implies
that
"
there
"
is
likely
the
same
location
as
the
garden
,
since
Mary
is
associated
with
the
garden
.
Answer
:
no
(
assuming
"
there
"
is
the
garden
,
but
we
don
't
have
direct
evidence
of
Daniel
's
location
)
