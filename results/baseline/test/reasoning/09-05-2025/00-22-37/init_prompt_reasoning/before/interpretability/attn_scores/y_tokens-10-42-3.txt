Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
,
and
we
know
from
sentence

7
that
Mary
is
in
the
bedroom
.
However
,
sentence

8
states
that
Mary
is
also
in
the
school
.
Since
both
sentences
provide
conflicting
information
,
we
can
infer
that
Mary
is
in
both
the
bedroom
and
the
school
,
which
is
a
contradictory
statement
.
Answer
:
yes
