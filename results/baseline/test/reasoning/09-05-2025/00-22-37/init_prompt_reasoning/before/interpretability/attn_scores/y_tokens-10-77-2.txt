Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Fred
's
current
location
,
and
we
have
two
sentences
that
provide
information
about
his
location
.
Sentence

4
states
that
Fred
is
in
the
school
,
which
implies
that
he
was
in
the
school
at
some
point
.
Sentence

5
states
that
Fred
went
to
the
cinema
,
which
suggests
that
he
moved
from
the
school
to
the
cinema
.
Since
Fred
went
to
the
cinema
,
it
is
likely
that
he
is
currently
in
the
cinema
.
