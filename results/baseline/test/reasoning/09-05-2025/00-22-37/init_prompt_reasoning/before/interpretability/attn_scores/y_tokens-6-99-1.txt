Reason
ing
:
According
to
sentence

2
,
John
moved
to
the
kitchen
,
which
implies
that
John
is
currently
in
the
kitchen
.
However
,
sentence

1
only
states
that
John
travelled
to
the
bathroom
,
which
does
not
necessarily
mean
he
is
still
there
.
Since
sentence

2
is
more
recent
and
indicates
John
's
current
location
,
we
can
infer
that
John
is
indeed
in
the
kitchen
.
