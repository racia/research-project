Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
John
's
location
,
and
the
information
provided
is
that
Mary
went
back
to
the
hallway
and
John
went
to
the
office
.
Since
Mary
went
back
to
the
hallway
,
it
implies
that
she
was
not
in
the
hallway
initially
.
However
,
there
is
no
information
about
John
's
initial
location
,
so
we
cannot
conclude
that
he
is
in
the
hallway
.
