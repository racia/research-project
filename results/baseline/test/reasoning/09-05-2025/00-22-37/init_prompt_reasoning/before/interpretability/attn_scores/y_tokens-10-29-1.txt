Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
provide
information
about
Mary
's
journey
to
the
park
,
but
there
is
no
mention
of
Fred
being
in
the
park
.
The
second
sentence
seems
to
be
a
repetition
of
the
first
sentence
,
which
doesn
't
provide
any
new
information
.
Therefore
,
we
can
focus
on
Mary
's
journey
to
the
park
.
