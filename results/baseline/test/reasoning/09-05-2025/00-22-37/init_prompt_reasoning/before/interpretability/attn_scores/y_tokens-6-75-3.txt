Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
mention
Daniel
grabbing
the
apple
there
,
and
Mary
picking
up
the
milk
there
.
Since
both
actions
are
happening
in
the
same
location
,
it
can
be
inferred
that
Daniel
is
in
the
same
location
as
Mary
.
The
context
sentence
"
Daniel
travelled
to
the
garden
"
(
from
previous
context
)
suggests
that
Daniel
is
indeed
in
the
garden
.
