Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
current
location
,
and
we
have
two
sentences
that
provide
information
about
her
location
.
Sentence

10
states
that
Mary
travelled
to
the
office
,
which
implies
that
she
was
not
in
the
office
initially
.
Sentence

11
states
that
Mary
moved
to
the
bedroom
,
which
suggests
that
she
is
currently
in
the
bedroom
.
There
is
no
mention
of
Mary
going
to
the
cinema
or
any
other
location
that
would
suggest
she
is
currently
in
the
cinema
.
Answer
:
no
