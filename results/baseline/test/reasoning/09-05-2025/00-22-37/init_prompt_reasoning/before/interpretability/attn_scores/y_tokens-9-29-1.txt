Reason
ing
:
Since
John
went
back
to
the
garden
,
it
implies
that
he
was
not
in
the
garden
initially
.
However
,
the
sentence
"
John
is
not
in
the
bathroom
"
suggests
that
John
is
not
in
the
bathroom
.
There
is
no
information
that
contrad
icts
John
being
in
the
garden
.
Additionally
,
the
sentence
"
John
went
back
to
the
garden
"
implies
that
John
was
in
the
garden
at
some
point
,
which
is
consistent
with
the
initial
statement
.
