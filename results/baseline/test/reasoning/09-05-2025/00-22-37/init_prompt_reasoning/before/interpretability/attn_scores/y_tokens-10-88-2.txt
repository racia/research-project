Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
provide
two
contradictory
statements
about
Bill
's
location
.
One
says
Bill
is
in
the
park
,
and
the
other
says
Bill
is
in
the
kitchen
.
Since
these
statements
cannot
both
be
true
,
we
need
to
consider
the
possibility
that
one
of
them
is
false
or
outdated
.
Answer
:
Yes
