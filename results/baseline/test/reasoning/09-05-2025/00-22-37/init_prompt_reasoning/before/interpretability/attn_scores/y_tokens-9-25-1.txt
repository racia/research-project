Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Daniel
's
location
,
and
we
know
from
sentence

2
that
Daniel
is
in
the
kitchen
.
There
is
no
information
provided
about
Daniel
's
movement
or
change
in
location
,
so
we
can
assume
he
is
still
in
the
kitchen
.
The
hallway
is
not
mentioned
as
a
location
for
Daniel
in
any
of
the
context
sentences
.
Answer
:
no
