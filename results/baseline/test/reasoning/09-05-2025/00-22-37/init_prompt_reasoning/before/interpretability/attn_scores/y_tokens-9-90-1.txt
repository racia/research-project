Reason
ing
:
John
is
no
longer
in
the
kitchen
,
which
means
he
was
in
the
kitchen
at
some
point
,
but
he
is
not
there
now
.
Then
,
John
went
back
to
the
garden
,
which
implies
that
he
was
not
in
the
garden
initially
,
but
he
returned
there
.
Since
John
is
no
longer
in
the
kitchen
,
it
's
likely
that
he
is
in
the
garden
now
.
