Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentence

7
states
that
Julie
is
either
in
the
school

the
school
.
This
is
a
contradictory
statement
,
as
it
implies
that
Julie
is
in
the
same
location
,
which
is
the
school
.
This
is
a
logical
contradiction
,
and
we
cannot
determine
Julie
's
location
based
on
this
information
.
