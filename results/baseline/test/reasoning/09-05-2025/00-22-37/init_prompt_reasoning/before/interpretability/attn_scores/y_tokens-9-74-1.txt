Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
John
's
location
,
and
the
only
information
provided
is
that
John
is
in
the
bedroom
.
There
is
no
mention
of
John
being
in
the
office
or
any
other
location
.
Since
the
question
asks
about
John
's
presence
in
the
office
,
and
there
is
no
evidence
to
suggest
he
is
,
the
answer
is
based
on
the
absence
of
information
.
Answer
:
no
