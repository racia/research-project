Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Fred
's
location
,
and
we
have
two
context
sentences
that
provide
information
about
Fred
's
location
.
Sentence

1
states
that
Fred
is
in
the
bedroom
,
and
sentence

2
states
that
Fred
is
in
the
school
.
Since
both
sentences
provide
contradictory
information
,
we
need
to
consider
the
context
and
the
relationships
between
the
entities
.
Answer
:
yes
