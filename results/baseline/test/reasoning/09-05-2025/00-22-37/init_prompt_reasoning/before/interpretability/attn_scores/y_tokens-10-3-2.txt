Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Julie
's
location
,
and
we
know
from
sentence

2
of
the
previous
task
(
2
.
Julie
is
either
in
the
school
or
the
cinema
.)
that
Julie
is
either
in
the
school
or
the
cinema
.
However
,
we
don
't
have
any
information
about
Julie
being
in
the
bedroom
.
Since
Fred
is
in
the
bedroom
(
sentence

4
),
we
can
conclude
that
Julie
is
not
in
the
bedroom
.
