Reason
ing
:
Since
Daniel
went
to
the
garden
,
there
is
no
direct
information
about
his
current
location
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
he
is
not
in
the
hallway
since
Mary
is
no
longer
in
the
hallway
.
There
is
no
mention
of
Daniel
being
in
the
bedroom
,
so
we
cannot
conclude
that
he
is
in
the
bedroom
.
