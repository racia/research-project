Here are the context sentences:
1. The yellow square is above the pink rectangle.
2. The triangle is to the right of the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square to the left of the triangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the right of the pink rectangle (sentence 2). since the triangle is to the right of the pink rectangle, and the yellow square is above the pink rectangle, it can be logically inferred that the yellow square is to the left of the triangle.	fully	no	False	The yellow square is above the pink rectangle, and the triangle is to the right of the pink rectangle. Since the yellow square is above the pink rectangle, it is not directly related to the triangle's position. However, we can infer that the triangle is to the right of the pink rectangle, which means it is not to the left of the yellow square.
