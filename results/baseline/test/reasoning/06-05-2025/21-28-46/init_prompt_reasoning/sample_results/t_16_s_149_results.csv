Here are the context sentences:
1. Brian is a swan.
2. Greg is a lion.
3. Julius is a swan.
4. Greg is white.
5. Brian is gray.
6. Bernhard is a swan.
7. Julius is white.
8. Bernhard is white.
9. Lily is a lion.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	white	since lily is a lion (sentence 9), and greg is also a lion (sentence 2), we can infer that lily and greg share the same characteristics. sentence 4 states that greg is white, so it is logical to assume that lily, being a lion like greg, is also white.	fully	Not mentioned	False	The question asks about the color of Lily, who is a lion according to sentence 9. Since the color of a lion is not specified in the given context, we need to infer it based on the information provided. Sentence 4 states that Greg, who is a lion, is white. However, this does not necessarily mean that all lions are white. Therefore, we cannot conclude the color of Lily based on the color of Greg.
