Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is to the left of the triangle.
2. The red square is to the right of the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle above the yellow square?"	no	from context sentence 1, we know that the red square is to the left of the triangle. from context sentence 2, we know that the red square is to the right of the yellow square. this implies that the yellow square is to the left of the red square. since the red square is to the left of the triangle, the yellow square must also be to the left of the triangle. there is no information provided about the vertical positions of the triangle and the yellow square	fully	no	True	Since the red square is to the left of the triangle, it implies that the triangle is not on the leftmost side. Also, the red square is to the right of the yellow square, which means the yellow square is on the left side. Since the triangle is not on the leftmost side, it cannot be above the yellow square.
