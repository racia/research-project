Here are the context sentences:
1. Greg is a rhino.
2. Julius is a swan.
3. Bernhard is a lion.
4. Julius is white.
5. Greg is yellow.
6. Bernhard is yellow.
7. Lily is a frog.
8. Lily is gray.
9. Brian is a rhino.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Brian?"	yellow	since brian is a rhino (sentence 9), and greg is also a rhino (sentence 1), it can be inferred that they share similar characteristics. one of these characteristics is their color, as seen in sentence 5, where greg is yellow. therefore, it is logical to assume that brian, being a rhino like greg, is also yellow.	fully	yellow	True	Since Brian is a rhino (from sentence 9), and Greg is a rhino (from sentence 1), we can infer that Brian's color is likely to be the same as Greg's. Greg is yellow (from sentence 5), so Brian's color is also yellow.		"Reasoning: Since Brian is a rhino (from sentence 9), and Greg is a rhino (from sentence 1), we can infer that Brian's color is likely to be the same as Greg's. Greg is yellow (from sentence 5), so Brian's color is also yellow.
