Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is above the yellow square.
2. The triangle is below the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square to the right of the triangle?"	no	the context sentences describe the relative positions of the blue square, yellow square, and triangle in a vertical arrangement. sentence 1 states that the blue square is above the yellow square, and sentence 2 states that the triangle is below the yellow square. there is no information provided about the horizontal positions of these objects. therefore, we cannot conclude that the blue square is to the right of the triangle. in fact, based on the vertical arrangement, it is more likely that the blue square	fully	no	True	The blue square is above the yellow square, and the triangle is below the yellow square. This means the blue square and the triangle are not directly related in terms of vertical position. However, the blue square is above the yellow square, which is above the triangle. This implies that the blue square is to the left of the triangle.		"Reasoning: The blue square is above the yellow square, and the triangle is below the yellow square.
