Here are the context sentences:
1. Bernhard is a lion.
2. Julius is a lion.
3. Greg is a frog.
4. Brian is a lion.
5. Brian is green.
6. Lily is a frog.
7. Julius is green.
8. Bernhard is green.
9. Greg is green.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	green	since lily is a frog (sentence 6), and all the other frogs mentioned (greg) are green (sentence 9), it is logical to assume that lily, being a frog as well, is also green.	fully	green	True	Since Lily is a frog (sentence 6), and frogs are not typically associated with a specific color, we cannot infer a specific color for Lily. However, we can consider the colors of the other frogs mentioned: Greg is green (sentence 9), and Lily is not mentioned as having a specific color. Therefore, we can assume that Lily is likely green, as it is the only color mentioned for frogs in the context.
