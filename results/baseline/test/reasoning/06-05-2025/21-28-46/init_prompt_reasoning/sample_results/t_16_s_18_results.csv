Here are the context sentences:
1. Lily is a lion.
2. Julius is a swan.
3. Greg is a rhino.
4. Lily is gray.
5. Greg is green.
6. Brian is a rhino.
7. Julius is gray.
8. Bernhard is a lion.
9. Bernhard is white.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Brian?"	green	since brian is a rhino (sentence 6), and greg is also a rhino (sentence 3), and greg is green (sentence 5), it can be logically inferred that brian, being of the same species as greg, shares the same color, which is green.	fully		False	The question asks about the color of Brian, who is a rhino according to sentence 3. Since the color of rhinos is not mentioned in the given context, we need to infer it logically. We can do this by comparing Brian with Greg, who is also a rhino and has a specific color mentioned in sentence 5, which is green. However, we cannot directly conclude that Brian's color is also green because there is no direct information about Brian's color.		Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Brian, who is a rhino according to sentence 3. Since the color of rhinos is not mentioned in the given context, we need to infer it logically. We can do this by comparing Brian with Greg, who is also a rhino and has a specific color mentioned in sentence 5, which is green.
