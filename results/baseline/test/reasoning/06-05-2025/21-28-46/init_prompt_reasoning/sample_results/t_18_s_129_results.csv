Here are the context sentences:
1. The suitcase is bigger than the box.
2. The chocolate fits inside the suitcase.
3. The suitcase is bigger than the chocolate.
4. The suitcase fits inside the chest.
5. The chocolate fits inside the container.

Now, answer the following question:
Does the box fit in the chest?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know the suitcase is bigger than the box. from context sentence 4, we know the suitcase fits inside the chest. since the suitcase is bigger than the box, and the suitcase fits inside the chest, it can be logically inferred that the box, being smaller than the suitcase, will also fit inside the chest.	fully		False	Since the suitcase is bigger than the box (sentence 1), and the suitcase fits inside the chest (sentence 4), it implies that the chest is bigger than the box. Additionally, the chocolate fits inside the suitcase (sentence 2), and the suitcase is bigger than the chocolate (sentence 3). This means that the chocolate is smaller than the suitcase. Since the chocolate fits inside the container (sentence 5), it implies that the container is bigger than the chocolate.		Reasoning: Since the suitcase is bigger than the box (sentence 1), and the suitcase fits inside the chest (sentence 4), it implies that the chest is bigger than the box. Additionally, the chocolate fits inside the suitcase (sentence 2), and the suitcase is bigger than the chocolate (sentence 3). This means that the chocolate is smaller than the suitcase. Since the chocolate fits inside the container (sentence 5), it implies that the container is bigger than the chocolate.	0.1313	0.0202	False	False	False	False	0
