Here are the context sentences:
1. The yellow square is to the left of the triangle.
2. The yellow square is above the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the right of the triangle?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 1) and the yellow square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 2). since the yellow square is above the pink rectangle, the pink rectangle must be below the yellow square. if the pink rectangle is below the yellow square and the yellow square is to the left of the triangle, then the pink rectangle cannot be to the right of the triangle. therefore, the answer is no	fully	no	True	Since the yellow square is to the left of the triangle, it implies that the triangle is not to the left of the yellow square. Also, the yellow square is above the pink rectangle, which means the pink rectangle is below the yellow square. Combining these two pieces of information, we can conclude that the pink rectangle is not to the left of the triangle.
