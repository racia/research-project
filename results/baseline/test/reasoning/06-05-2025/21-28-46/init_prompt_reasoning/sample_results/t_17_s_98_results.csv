Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is above the pink rectangle.
2. The triangle is to the left of the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the right of the pink rectangle?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the blue square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the left of the blue square (sentence 2). since the triangle is to the left of the blue square, and the blue square is above the pink rectangle, it can be logically inferred that the triangle is to the left of the pink rectangle as well. therefore, the triangle is not to the right of the pink rectangle, which leads to the answer	fully	yes	False	The triangle is to the left of the blue square, and the blue square is above the pink rectangle. Since the triangle is to the left of the blue square, it is not directly related to the pink rectangle. However, the blue square is above the pink rectangle, which means the pink rectangle is below the blue square. Since the triangle is to the left of the blue square, it is also to the left of the pink rectangle.
