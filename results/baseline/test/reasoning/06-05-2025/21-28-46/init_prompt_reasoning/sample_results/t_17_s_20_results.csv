Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is to the right of the blue square.
2. The red sphere is below the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the right of the red sphere?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is to the right of the blue square (sentence 1), and the red sphere is below the blue square (sentence 2). since the pink rectangle is to the right of the blue square, and the red sphere is below the blue square, it can be logically inferred that the pink rectangle is to the right of the red sphere.	fully	No	False	The pink rectangle is to the right of the blue square, and the red sphere is below the blue square. There is no information about the relation between the pink rectangle and the red sphere. However, we can infer that the pink rectangle is not above the red sphere, because the red sphere is below the blue square, and the pink rectangle is to the right of the blue square. This means that the pink rectangle cannot be above the red sphere.		"Reasoning: The pink rectangle is to the right of the blue square, and the red sphere is below the blue square.
