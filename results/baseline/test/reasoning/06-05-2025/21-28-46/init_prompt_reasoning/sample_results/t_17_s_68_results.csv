Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is to the left of the red square.
2. The red sphere is to the left of the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the right of the red sphere?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the blue square is to the left of the red square. from context sentence 2, we know that the red sphere is to the left of the blue square. therefore, the red sphere is to the left of the blue square, and the blue square is to the left of the red square. this implies that the red sphere is to the left of the red square. since the red sphere is to the left of the red square,	fully	no	False	The question asks about the relation between the red square and the red sphere. From sentence 2, we know that the red sphere is to the left of the blue square. From sentence 1, we know that the blue square is to the left of the red square.
