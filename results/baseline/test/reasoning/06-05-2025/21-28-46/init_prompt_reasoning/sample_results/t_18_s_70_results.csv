4. The container is bigger than the chest.
5. The box of chocolates fits inside the suitcase.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the chocolate bigger than the suitcase?"	no	from context sentence 3, we know that the container is bigger than the chocolate. from context sentence 1, we know that the container fits inside the suitcase. therefore, if the container fits inside the suitcase, and the chocolate is smaller than the container, it logically follows that the chocolate must also fit inside the suitcase, and thus cannot be bigger than the suitcase.	fully	no	True	The chocolate is smaller than the container (from sentence 3), and the container fits inside the suitcase (from sentence 1). Therefore, the chocolate is also smaller than the suitcase.		"Reasoning: The chocolate is smaller than the container (from sentence 3), and the container fits inside the suitcase (from sentence 1).
