Here are the context sentences:
1. Brian is a frog.
2. Lily is a rhino.
3. Greg is a lion.
4. Julius is a swan.
5. Greg is green.
6. Lily is yellow.
7. Julius is green.
8. Brian is green.
9. Bernhard is a lion.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Bernhard?"	green	since bernhard is a lion (sentence 9), and greg is also a lion (sentence 3), we can infer that bernhard and greg share the same characteristics. we know that greg is green (sentence 5), so it is logical to assume that bernhard, being a lion like greg, is also green.	fully	Not mentioned	False	Bernhard is mentioned as a lion in sentence 9, and Julius is also a swan, which is a different species from a lion. Therefore, Bernhard's color is not specified in the context sentences, but we can infer that it is not green or yellow, as those colors are already assigned to other animals.		"Reasoning: Bernhard is mentioned as a lion in sentence 9, and Julius is also a swan, which is a different species from a lion. Therefore, Bernhard's color is not specified in the context sentences, but we can infer that it is not green or yellow, as those colors are already assigned to other animals.
