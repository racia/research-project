Here are the context sentences:
1. Lily is a frog.
2. Bernhard is a rhino.
3. Julius is a rhino.
4. Greg is a swan.
5. Bernhard is gray.
6. Lily is white.
7. Greg is gray.
8. Brian is a swan.
9. Julius is gray.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Brian?"	gray	since brian is a swan (sentence 8), and greg is also a swan (sentence 4), and greg is gray (sentence 7), it can be logically inferred that brian, being of the same species as greg, is also gray.	fully	Gray	True	The question asks about the color of Brian, who is a swan according to sentence 8. Since swans are not mentioned to have a specific color in the given context, we need to infer the color based on the information provided. Sentence 7 states that Greg, who is also a swan, is gray. This might suggest that swans are generally gray. However, this is an assumption and not a direct statement.
