Here are the context sentences:
1. The box is bigger than the chocolate.
2. The chest is bigger than the box of chocolates.
3. The box fits inside the chest.
4. The chest is bigger than the chocolate.
5. The box is bigger than the box of chocolates.

Now, answer the following question:
Does the chocolate fit in the chest?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know the box is bigger than the chocolate. from context sentence 3, we know the box fits inside the chest. therefore, if the box can fit inside the chest and the chocolate is smaller than the box, it logically follows that the chocolate can also fit inside the chest.	fully	yes	True	Since the box fits inside the chest (sentence 3), and the box is bigger than the chocolate (sentence 1), it implies that the box of chocolates (which is bigger than the box, sentence 5) also fits inside the chest. Since the chest is bigger than the chocolate (sentence 4), it means that the chocolate itself fits inside the chest.		"Reasoning: Since the box fits inside the chest (sentence 3), and the box is bigger than the chocolate (sentence 1), it implies that the box of chocolates (which is bigger than the box, sentence 5) also fits inside the chest. Since the chest is bigger than the chocolate (sentence 4), it means that the chocolate itself fits inside the chest.
