1. The office is south of the hallway.
2. The bedroom is north of the hallway.
3. The kitchen is north of the garden.
4. The hallway is east of the kitchen.
5. The garden is east of the bathroom.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the hallway to the garden?"	west south	from sentence 4, we know the hallway is east of the kitchen. from sentence 3, we know the kitchen is north of the garden. therefore, if we are in the hallway and want to go to the garden, we need to go west (to reach the kitchen) and then south (to reach the garden from the kitchen). hence, the correct direction is west south.	fully	east	False	Since the hallway is east of the kitchen (sentence 4), and the kitchen is north of the garden (sentence 3), we can infer that the hallway is east of the garden. To go from the hallway to the garden, we need to move east.		"Reasoning: Since the hallway is east of the kitchen (sentence 4), and the kitchen is north of the garden (sentence 3), we can infer that the hallway is east of the garden.
