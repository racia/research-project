Here are the context sentences:
1. Greg is a lion.
2. Julius is a rhino.
3. Bernhard is a lion.
4. Brian is a rhino.
5. Julius is gray.
6. Lily is a rhino.
7. Brian is green.
8. Bernhard is white.
9. Lily is green.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	white	since greg is a lion (context sentence 1), and bernhard is also a lion (context sentence 3), we can infer that greg and bernhard share similar characteristics. additionally, bernhard is white (context sentence 8). therefore, it is logical to assume that greg, being a lion like bernhard, also shares the same color, which is white.	fully	Not mentioned	False	The question asks about the color of Greg, who is a lion according to sentence 1. Since the color of a lion is not specified, we need to infer it. However, sentence 5 mentions the color of Julius, who is a rhino, as gray. Since lions and rhinos are different animals, their colors are not necessarily related. Therefore, we cannot infer the color of Greg from the information provided.
