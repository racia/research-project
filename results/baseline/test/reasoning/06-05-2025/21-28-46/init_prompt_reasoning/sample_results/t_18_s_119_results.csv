Here are the context sentences:

4. The box of chocolates fits inside the box.

7. The box is bigger than the box of chocolates.
8. The chocolate fits inside the container.
9. The box of chocolates is bigger than the chocolate.
10. The container is bigger than the chocolate.

Now, answer the following question:
Does the box fit in the chocolate?"	no	"from sentence 7, we know that ""the box is bigger than the box of chocolates"". from sentence 9, we know that ""the box of chocolates is bigger than the chocolate"". combining these two statements, we can logically conclude that the box is also bigger than the chocolate. therefore, it is not possible for the box to fit inside the chocolate, hence the answer is ""no""."	fully	no	True	The context sentences do not mention the box fitting inside the chocolate. In fact, sentence 6 states that the chest is bigger than the chocolate, implying that the chocolate is not large enough to fit the box. Additionally, sentence 8 states that the chocolate fits inside the container, but not the other way around, suggesting that the chocolate is relatively small.
