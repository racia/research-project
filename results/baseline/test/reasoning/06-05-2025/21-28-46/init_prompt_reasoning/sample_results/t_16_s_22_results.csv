Here are the context sentences:
1. Greg is a rhino.
2. Greg is yellow.
3. Brian is a lion.
4. Julius is a frog.
5. Bernhard is a rhino.
6. Julius is green.
7. Brian is green.
8. Bernhard is yellow.
9. Lily is a lion.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	green	since lily is a lion (sentence 9), and brian is also a lion (sentence 3), we can infer that lily and brian share the same characteristics. we know that brian is green (sentence 7), so it is logical to assume that lily is also green.	fully		False	The question asks about the color of Lily, who is a lion. Since lions are not mentioned as having a specific color in the context sentences, we need to infer the answer based on the colors of other lions. Brian is a lion and is green, which suggests that lions can be green. However, we cannot conclude that Lily is green without additional information. Since Lily is also a lion, we can assume that she might have a similar color to Brian, which is green.		Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Lily, who is a lion. Since lions are not mentioned as having a specific color in the context sentences, we need to infer the answer based on the colors of other lions. Brian is a lion and is green, which suggests that lions can be green. However, we cannot conclude that Lily is green without additional information.
