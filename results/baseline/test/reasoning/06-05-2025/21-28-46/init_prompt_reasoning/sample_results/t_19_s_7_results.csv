1. The office is south of the garden.
2. The garden is west of the bedroom.
3. The bathroom is east of the bedroom.
4. The bedroom is north of the hallway.
5. The kitchen is north of the garden.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the bedroom to the kitchen?"	west north	to go from the bedroom to the kitchen, we need to find the shortest path between the two locations. from sentence 2, we know the garden is west of the bedroom. from sentence 5, we know the kitchen is north of the garden. therefore, to reach the kitchen from the bedroom, we need to go west (to reach the garden) and then north (to reach the kitchen). hence, the correct direction is west north.	fully	east, north	False	Since the bedroom is north of the hallway (sentence 4), and the kitchen is north of the garden (sentence 5), we can infer that the bedroom is also north of the garden. Additionally, the garden is west of the bedroom (sentence 2), which means the bedroom is east of the garden. Combining these directions, we can conclude that to go from the bedroom to the kitchen, we need to go east and then north.
