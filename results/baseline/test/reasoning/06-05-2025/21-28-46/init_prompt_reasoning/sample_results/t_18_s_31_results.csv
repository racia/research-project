4. The chocolate fits inside the container.
5. The box of chocolates is bigger than the chocolate.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the box bigger than the chocolate?"	yes	"from sentence 5, we know that ""the box of chocolates is bigger than the chocolate."" this directly states that the box (of chocolates) is bigger than the chocolate, which answers the question affirmatively."	fully	yes	True	The box of chocolates is bigger than the chocolate (sentence 5), and the box of chocolates fits inside the chest (sentence 3). The chest is bigger than the suitcase (sentence 1), but the box is bigger than the container (sentence 2). This implies that the box is bigger than the chest, and the chest is bigger than the suitcase. Therefore, the box is bigger than the chocolate.

Now, answer the following question:
Does the chest fit in the chocolate?"	no	"from the context sentences, we know that ""the box of chocolates fits inside the chest"" (sentence 3) and ""the box of chocolates is bigger than the chocolate"" (sentence 5). this implies that the chest is bigger than the box of chocolates, and the box of chocolates is bigger than the chocolate. therefore, it can be logically concluded that the chest is bigger than the chocolate, which means the chest cannot fit inside the chocolate."	none	no	True	The box of chocolates fits inside the chest (sentence 3), and the chocolate fits inside the container (sentence 4). This implies that the chocolate is not a container, but rather a small object.
