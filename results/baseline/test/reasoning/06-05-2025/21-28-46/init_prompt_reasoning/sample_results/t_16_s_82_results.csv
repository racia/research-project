Here are the context sentences:
1. Bernhard is a rhino.
2. Brian is a frog.
3. Brian is gray.
4. Julius is a swan.
5. Greg is a frog.
6. Bernhard is green.
7. Julius is green.
8. Greg is yellow.
9. Lily is a rhino.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	green	since lily is a rhino (sentence 9), and bernhard is also a rhino (sentence 1), we can infer that they share similar characteristics. bernhard is green (sentence 6), so it is logical to assume that lily, being a rhino as well, is also green.	fully	green	True	The question asks about the color of Lily, who is mentioned in sentence 9 as a rhino. Since Bernhard, also a rhino, is green (sentence 6), it's possible that Lily, being a rhino, might also be green. However, there's no direct mention of Lily's color. The only clue is the similarity with Bernhard's color.		"Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Lily, who is mentioned in sentence 9 as a rhino.
