4. The bedroom is north of the kitchen.
5. The hallway is west of the garden.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the hallway to the kitchen?"	east east	from sentence 5, we know that the hallway is west of the garden. from sentence 2, we know that the kitchen is east of the garden. therefore, to go from the hallway to the kitchen, we need to move east from the hallway. since the kitchen is east of the garden, and the hallway is west of the garden, we need to move east twice (i.e., east east) to reach the kitchen from the hallway.	fully	east	True	Since the hallway is west of the garden (sentence 5), and the kitchen is east of the garden (sentence 2), we can infer that the hallway and kitchen are on opposite sides of the garden.
