Here are the context sentences:
1. The bedroom is west of the hallway.
2. The kitchen is east of the hallway.
3. The garden is south of the bathroom.
4. The office is east of the bathroom.
5. The office is north of the hallway.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the bathroom to the hallway?"	east south	from sentence 5, we know the office is east of the bathroom, and the office is also north of the hallway. this implies that the hallway is south of the office. since the office is east of the bathroom, we need to go west to reach the office from the bathroom. then, we need to go south to reach the hallway from the office. therefore, to go from the bathroom to the hallway, we need to go east and then south.	fully	north, east	False	Since the bathroom is south of the garden (sentence 3), and the hallway is east of the bathroom (not explicitly mentioned, but can be inferred as the hallway is not mentioned as being west of the bathroom), we can conclude that the bathroom is not directly adjacent to the hallway. Therefore, to go from the bathroom to the hallway, we need to move north (sentence 5) and then east (sentence 2).
