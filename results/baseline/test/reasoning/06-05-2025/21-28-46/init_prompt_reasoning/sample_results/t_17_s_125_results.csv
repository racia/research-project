Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle.
2. The triangle is to the left of the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square above the pink rectangle?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the left of the blue square (sentence 2). this implies that the blue square is to the right of the triangle, and the triangle is to the right of the pink rectangle. since the pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle, and the triangle is to the left of the blue square, we can conclude that the blue square is	fully	no	True	The context sentences only provide information about the relative positions of the pink rectangle and the triangle, and the triangle and the blue square. There is no direct information about the relative positions of the blue square and the pink rectangle.		"Reasoning: The context sentences only provide information about the relative positions of the pink rectangle and the triangle, and the triangle and the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle above the blue square?"	no	the context sentences do not provide any information about the vertical relationships between the objects, only about their horizontal relationships. the question asks about a vertical relationship (above), but there is no information to suggest that the pink rectangle is above the blue square. in fact, the context sentences only mention left and right relationships, which do not imply any vertical relationships. therefore, we cannot conclude that the pink rectangle is above the blue square, and the answer is no.	none	unknown	False	The context sentences do not provide any information about the relative vertical positions of the pink rectangle and the blue square.
