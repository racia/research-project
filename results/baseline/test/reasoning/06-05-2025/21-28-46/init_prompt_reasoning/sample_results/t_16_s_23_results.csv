Here are the context sentences:
1. Greg is a swan.
2. Greg is gray.
3. Julius is a frog.
4. Lily is a rhino.
5. Lily is yellow.
6. Julius is green.
7. Brian is a frog.
8. Brian is green.
9. Bernhard is a rhino.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Bernhard?"	yellow	since bernhard is a rhino (sentence 9), and lily is also a rhino (sentence 4) and yellow (sentence 5), it can be logically inferred that bernhard, being a rhino like lily, is also yellow.	fully	yellow	True	Bernhard is a rhino, and Lily is a rhino, but Lily is yellow. Since Bernhard is also a rhino, it's likely that Bernhard's color is not yellow, as it would be redundant. However, there's no information about Bernhard's color being different from Lily's. Therefore, it's possible that Bernhard's color is also yellow.		"Reasoning: Bernhard is a rhino, and Lily is a rhino, but Lily is yellow.
