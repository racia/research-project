Here are the context sentences:
1. The office is east of the hallway.
2. The kitchen is east of the office.
3. The office is south of the bedroom.
4. The garden is south of the hallway.
5. The office is north of the bathroom.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the bedroom to the hallway?"	south west	from sentence 3, we know that the office is south of the bedroom. from sentence 1, we know that the office is east of the hallway. to go from the bedroom to the hallway, we need to move in the opposite direction of south (which is north) and then in the opposite direction of east (which is west). therefore, we need to go south-west from the bedroom to reach the hallway.	fully		False	Since the office is south of the bedroom (sentence 3), and the hallway is east of the garden (sentence 4), we can infer that the hallway is not directly adjacent to the bedroom. However, we know that the office is east of the hallway (sentence 1), and the office is south of the bedroom (sentence 3). This means that to get from the bedroom to the hallway, we need to go south to the office and then east to the hallway		Reasoning: Since the office is south of the bedroom (sentence 3), and the hallway is east of the garden (sentence 4), we can infer that the hallway is not directly adjacent to the bedroom. However, we know that the office is east of the hallway (sentence 1), and the office is south of the bedroom (sentence 3). This means that to get from the bedroom to the hallway, we need to go south to the office and then east to the hallway	0.1414	0.0202	False	False	False	False	0
