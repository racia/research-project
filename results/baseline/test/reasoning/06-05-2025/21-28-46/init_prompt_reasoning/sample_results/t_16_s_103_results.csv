Here are the context sentences:
1. Greg is a frog.
2. Greg is green.
3. Bernhard is a lion.
4. Lily is a swan.
5. Lily is gray.
6. Bernhard is gray.
7. Brian is a rhino.
8. Brian is green.
9. Julius is a frog.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Julius?"	green	since julius is a frog (sentence 9), and we know that greg is also a frog (sentence 1) and is green (sentence 2), it is logical to assume that julius, being a frog as well, shares the same characteristic of being green.	fully	green	True	Since Julius is a frog, and frogs are typically green, and Brian is also a frog and green, it's likely that Julius is also green. However, there's no direct mention of Julius' color. Bernhard, who is also a lion, is gray, but that doesn't necessarily imply Julius' color. The only information we have about Julius is that he's a frog, which doesn't provide a direct answer to his color.
