1. The yellow square is below the red square.
2. The yellow square is to the left of the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the right of the red sphere?"	no	"from context sentence 2, we know that the yellow square is to the left of the red sphere. since the yellow square is below the red square (context sentence 1), and the yellow square is to the left of the red sphere, it can be logically inferred that the red square is also to the left of the red sphere. therefore, the red square cannot be to the right of the red sphere, which leads to the answer ""no""."	fully	Not mentioned	False	The question asks about the relation between the red square and the red sphere. Since the yellow square is to the left of the red sphere, it implies that the red sphere has a position in the context. The red square is below the yellow square, which means the red square is below the red sphere as well. This information doesn't provide a direct answer about the red square's position relative to the red sphere.
