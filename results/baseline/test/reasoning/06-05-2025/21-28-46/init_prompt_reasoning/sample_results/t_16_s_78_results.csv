Here are the context sentences:
1. Julius is a frog.
2. Julius is gray.
3. Bernhard is a lion.
4. Bernhard is gray.
5. Lily is a swan.
6. Lily is white.
7. Greg is a lion.
8. Greg is gray.
9. Brian is a frog.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Brian?"	gray	since brian is a frog (sentence 9), and julius is also a frog (sentence 1) and is gray (sentence 2), it can be logically inferred that brian, being a frog like julius, is also gray.	fully	Gray	True	Since Brian is a frog (from sentence 1), and Julius is also a frog (from sentence 1), we can infer that Brian's color is likely to be similar to Julius's color, which is gray (from sentence 2). However, we don't have any direct information about Brian's color. Therefore, we need to consider the possibility that Brian's color might be different from Julius's.
