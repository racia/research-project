Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is to the left of the red sphere.
2. The blue square is to the right of the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere to the right of the pink rectangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the blue square is to the left of the red sphere (sentence 1) and the blue square is to the right of the pink rectangle (sentence 2). this means that the blue square is in the middle, with the red sphere on its left and the pink rectangle on its right. therefore, the red sphere must be to the left of the pink rectangle, which means the pink rectangle is to the right of the red sphere. hence	fully		False	From sentence 1, we know the blue square is to the left of the red sphere. From sentence 2, we know the blue square is to the right of the pink rectangle. Since the blue square is to the right of the pink rectangle, it means the pink rectangle is to the left of the blue square. Now, we need to determine the position of the red sphere relative to the pink rectangle. Since the blue square is to the left of the red sphere,		Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the blue square is to the left of the red sphere. From sentence 2, we know the blue square is to the right of the pink rectangle.
