Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is to the left of the triangle.
2. The blue square is below the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the right of the red square?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the blue square is to the left of the triangle. from context sentence 2, we know that the blue square is below the red square. since the blue square is below the red square, the triangle must be to the right of the red square, because the blue square is to the left of the triangle. therefore, the answer is yes, the triangle is to the right of the red square.	fully	yes	True	Since the blue square is to the left of the triangle, it means the triangle is not on the leftmost side. Also, the blue square is below the red square, which implies the red square is above the blue square. Combining these two facts, we can conclude that the triangle is not on the leftmost side and is not above the red square. Therefore, the triangle must be to the right of the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the left of the triangle?"	yes	from the previous context sentences, we know that the blue square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 1) and the blue square is below the red square (sentence 2). since the blue square is below the red square, the red square must be above the blue square. and since the blue square is to the left of the triangle, the red square (which is above the blue square) must also be to the left of the triangle. therefore, the answer is	none	no	False	We already know that the blue square is to the left of the triangle (from sentence 1). Since the blue square is below the red square (from sentence 2), it implies that the red square is above the blue square. Therefore, the red square cannot be to the left of the triangle, as it would be above the blue square, which is already to the left of the triangle.
