Here are the context sentences:
1. The garden is south of the kitchen.
2. The hallway is east of the bathroom.
3. The hallway is north of the office.
4. The bedroom is north of the hallway.
5. The bathroom is north of the kitchen.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the hallway to the kitchen?"	west south	from sentence 2, we know the hallway is east of the bathroom. from sentence 5, we know the bathroom is north of the kitchen. therefore, if we are in the hallway, we need to go west to reach the bathroom, and then south to reach the kitchen. hence, the correct direction to go from the hallway to the kitchen is west south.	fully	east	False	Since the hallway is east of the bathroom (sentence 2), and the bathroom is north of the kitchen (sentence 5), we can infer that the hallway is not directly adjacent to the kitchen. However, the hallway is also north of the office (sentence 3), and the kitchen is south of the garden (sentence 1). This suggests that the hallway is north of the kitchen, but not directly adjacent to it.
