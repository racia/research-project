Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is above the red sphere.
2. The pink rectangle is to the right of the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere to the left of the yellow square?"	no	from context sentence 1, we know that the pink rectangle is above the red sphere, which implies that the pink rectangle and the red sphere are in the same vertical line. from context sentence 2, we know that the pink rectangle is to the right of the yellow square. since the pink rectangle is above the red sphere, the red sphere must be to the left of the pink rectangle. therefore, the red sphere must be to the left of the pink rectangle, which is to	fully	no	True	The pink rectangle is above the red sphere, which means the red sphere is below the pink rectangle. The pink rectangle is also to the right of the yellow square, which means the yellow square is to the left of the pink rectangle.
