1. The hallway is east of the office.
2. The bedroom is north of the hallway.
3. The garden is east of the kitchen.
4. The bedroom is west of the kitchen.
5. The bathroom is east of the hallway.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the kitchen to the hallway?"	west south	from context sentence 4, we know that the bedroom is west of the kitchen. from context sentence 2, we know that the bedroom is north of the hallway. therefore, if we move west from the kitchen, we will reach the bedroom, and then if we move south from the bedroom, we will reach the hallway. hence, to go from the kitchen to the hallway, we need to move west and then south.	fully	east	False	Since the kitchen is east of the garden (sentence 3), and the hallway is east of the office (sentence 1), we can infer that the hallway is also east of the kitchen. Additionally, the bathroom is east of the hallway (sentence 5), which means the hallway is west of the bathroom. Combining these, we can conclude that the hallway is east of the kitchen, and the kitchen is west of the hallway.
