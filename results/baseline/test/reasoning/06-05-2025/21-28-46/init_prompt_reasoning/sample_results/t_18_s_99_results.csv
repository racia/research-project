Here are the context sentences:
1. The container is bigger than the box of chocolates.
2. The box is bigger than the box of chocolates.
3. The box is bigger than the chest.
4. The container fits inside the chest.
5. The suitcase fits inside the chest.

Now, answer the following question:
Does the box fit in the container?"	no	from sentence 2, we know the box is bigger than the box of chocolates. from sentence 1, we know the container is also bigger than the box of chocolates. if both the box and the container are bigger than the box of chocolates, it means the box is not smaller than the container. since the box is not smaller than the container, it cannot fit inside the container. therefore, the answer is no, the box does not fit in the container.	fully	yes	False	The box is bigger than the box of chocolates (sentence 2), and the box of chocolates is smaller than the container (sentence 1). This implies that the box is larger than the box of chocolates. Since the container is bigger than the box of chocolates (sentence 1), it is likely that the box fits inside the container.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the suitcase bigger than the box?"	no	from sentence 4, we know the container fits inside the chest. from sentence 5, we know the suitcase fits inside the chest. since both the container and the suitcase fit inside the chest, it means they are both smaller than or equal to the chest in size. there is no information suggesting the suitcase is bigger than the container, so it is likely that the suitcase is not bigger than the box (from sentence 2, the box is bigger than the chest). therefore,	none	no	True	The box is bigger than the chest (sentence 3), and the suitcase fits inside the chest (sentence 5).
