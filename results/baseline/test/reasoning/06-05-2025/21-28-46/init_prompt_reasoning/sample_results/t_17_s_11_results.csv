Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is to the left of the red sphere.
2. The blue square is below the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere below the pink rectangle?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the blue square is to the left of the red sphere. from context sentence 2, we know that the blue square is below the pink rectangle. since the blue square is below the pink rectangle and the red sphere is to the right of the blue square (from sentence 1), we can logically conclude that the red sphere is also below the pink rectangle.	fully		False	The question asks about the relation between the red sphere and the pink rectangle. Since the blue square is to the left of the red sphere, it implies that the red sphere is not on the same level as the blue square. The blue square is also below the pink rectangle, which means the pink rectangle is above the blue square. Since the red sphere is to the left of the blue square, it is not directly related to the pink rectangle's vertical position.
