4. Julius is a rhino.
5. Julius is white.
6. Bernhard is a lion.
7. Greg is white.
8. Lily is a rhino.
9. Lily is white.

Since Bernhard is a lion, it's possible to infer that Bernhard is not necessarily white, as Julius is white but Bernhard is not mentioned as white.		"Reasoning: Bernhard is a lion, and Julius is also a lion. Julius is white, but Bernhard's color is not mentioned. Since Bernhard is a lion, it's possible to infer that Bernhard is not necessarily white, as Julius is white but Bernhard is not mentioned as white.
