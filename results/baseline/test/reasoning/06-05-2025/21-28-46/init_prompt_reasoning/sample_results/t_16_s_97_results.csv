Here are the context sentences:
1. Brian is a frog.
2. Bernhard is a lion.
3. Brian is gray.
4. Julius is a frog.
5. Bernhard is gray.
6. Julius is white.
7. Greg is a frog.
8. Lily is a lion.
9. Greg is yellow.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	gray	since lily is a lion (sentence 8), and bernhard is also a lion (sentence 2), we can infer that lily's color is likely to be similar to bernhard's color. bernhard is gray (sentence 5), so it is logical to assume that lily is also gray.	fully	Not mentioned	False	The question asks about the color of Lily, who is described as a lion in sentence 8. Since lions are not typically associated with colors, we need to look for any information that might relate to Lily's color. However, there is no direct mention of Lily's color in the given sentences. We can try to infer Lily's color by looking at the colors associated with other lions, but that would be an assumption.
