Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is to the left of the blue square.
2. The pink rectangle is below the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square below the triangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the blue square (sentence 1) and the pink rectangle is below the triangle (sentence 2). since the pink rectangle is below the triangle, and the blue square is to the right of the pink rectangle, we can logically conclude that the blue square is also below the triangle.	fully	No	False	The question asks about the blue square's position relative to the triangle. Since the pink rectangle is below the triangle (from sentence 2), and the pink rectangle is to the left of the blue square (from sentence 1), we can infer that the blue square is not necessarily below the triangle. The blue square's position is only known to be to the right of the pink rectangle, which is below the triangle.
