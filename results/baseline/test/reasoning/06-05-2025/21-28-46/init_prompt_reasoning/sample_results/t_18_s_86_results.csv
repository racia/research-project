1. The box fits inside the chest.
2. The box fits inside the suitcase.
3. The chocolate fits inside the box.
4. The box fits inside the container.
5. The chocolate fits inside the box.

Now, answer the following question:
Does the chest fit in the chocolate?"	no	the question asks if the chest fits inside the chocolate. from the context sentences, we know that the box fits inside the chest (sentence 1), and the chocolate fits inside the box (sentences 3 and 5). this means that the chest is larger than the box, and the box is larger than the chocolate. therefore, it is not possible for the chest to fit inside the chocolate, as the chest is larger than the chocolate.	fully	No	True	The question asks if the chest fits inside the chocolate. However, the context sentences do not mention the chocolate having a size or shape that could accommodate the chest. In fact, the chocolate fits inside the box, which fits inside the chest. This implies that the chocolate is much smaller than the chest. Therefore, it is not possible for the chest to fit inside the chocolate.
