Here are the context sentences:
1. Brian is a rhino.
2. Julius is a swan.
3. Brian is gray.
4. Bernhard is a frog.
5. Greg is a rhino.
6. Greg is gray.
7. Bernhard is green.
8. Lily is a swan.
9. Julius is yellow.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	yellow	since lily is a swan (sentence 8), and julius is also a swan (sentence 2), we can infer that they share similar characteristics. julius is yellow (sentence 9), so it is logical to assume that lily, being a swan like julius, is also yellow.	fully	white	False	The question asks about the color of Lily, who is described as a swan in sentence 8. Since swans are typically white, and there is no mention of Lily having a different color, it can be inferred that Lily is likely white.		"Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Lily, who is described as a swan in sentence 8. Since swans are typically white, and there is no mention of Lily having a different color, it can be inferred that Lily is likely white.
