Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is to the left of the red square.
2. The red sphere is below the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere to the right of the triangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is to the left of the red square (sentence 1). we also know that the red sphere is below the red square (sentence 2). since the red sphere is below the red square, and the triangle is to the left of the red square, it can be logically inferred that the red sphere is to the right of the triangle.	fully	No	False	The question asks about the relative position of the red sphere and the triangle. Since the red sphere is below the red square, and the triangle is to the left of the red square, we need to consider the vertical and horizontal positions separately. The vertical position is already established, and the horizontal position is that the triangle is to the left of the red square. There is no information that suggests the red sphere is to the right of the triangle.		"Reasoning: The question asks about the relative position of the red sphere and the triangle.
