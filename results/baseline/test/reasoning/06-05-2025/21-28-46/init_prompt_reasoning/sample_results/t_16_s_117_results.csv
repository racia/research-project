2. Bernhard is a rhino.
3. Lily is a frog.
4. Lily is yellow.
5. Brian is a rhino.
6. Brian is green.
7. Julius is white.
8. Bernhard is green.
9. Greg is a lion.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	white	since greg is a lion (sentence 9), and julius is also a lion (sentence 1), it can be inferred that they share similar characteristics. additionally, julius is white (sentence 7). therefore, it is logical to assume that greg, being a lion like julius, also shares the same color, which is white.	fully	White	True	The question asks about the color of Greg, who is a lion according to sentence 9. Julius is also a lion and is white according to sentence 7. However, there is no direct information about Greg's color. Since Julius, another lion, is white, it is reasonable to assume that Greg, being a lion as well, might also be white.		"Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Greg, who is a lion according to sentence 9. Julius is also a lion and is white according to sentence 7. However, there is no direct information about Greg's color. Since Julius, another lion, is white, it is reasonable to assume that Greg, being a lion as well, might also be white.
