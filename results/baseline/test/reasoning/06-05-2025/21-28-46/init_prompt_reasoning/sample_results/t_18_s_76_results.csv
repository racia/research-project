Here are the context sentences:
1. The container is bigger than the suitcase.
2. The container is bigger than the box.
3. The chocolate fits inside the suitcase.
4. The suitcase is bigger than the chocolate.
5. The chest is bigger than the box of chocolates.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the chocolate bigger than the container?"	no	from context sentence 3, we know the chocolate fits inside the suitcase. from context sentence 4, we know the suitcase is bigger than the chocolate. from context sentence 1, we know the container is bigger than the suitcase. therefore, we can logically conclude that the container is bigger than the chocolate, which means the chocolate is not bigger than the container.	fully	no	True	The context sentences do not mention the chocolate's size in relation to the container. However, we can infer that the chocolate is smaller than the suitcase (from sentence 3) and the suitcase is smaller than the container (from sentence 1). Therefore, it is likely that the chocolate is smaller than the container.		"Reasoning: The context sentences do not mention the chocolate's size in relation to the container.
