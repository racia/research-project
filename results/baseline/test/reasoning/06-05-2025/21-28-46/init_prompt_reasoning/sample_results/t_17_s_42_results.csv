Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is above the blue square.
2. The blue square is above the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square below the triangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is above the blue square (sentence 1), and the blue square is above the yellow square (sentence 2). therefore, we can logically conclude that the triangle is above the yellow square, which means the yellow square is below the triangle.	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the triangle is above the blue square. From sentence 2, we know the blue square is above the yellow square. This implies that the yellow square is below the blue square, and since the blue square is above the triangle, the yellow square must be below the triangle.		"Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the triangle is above the blue square. From sentence 2, we know the blue square is above the yellow square.
