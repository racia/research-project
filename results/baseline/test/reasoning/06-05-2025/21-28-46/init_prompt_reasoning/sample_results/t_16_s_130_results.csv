Here are the context sentences:
1. Bernhard is a lion.
2. Brian is a frog.
3. Bernhard is gray.
4. Lily is a lion.
5. Brian is gray.
6. Julius is a swan.
7. Lily is gray.
8. Greg is a swan.
9. Greg is yellow.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Julius?"	yellow	since julius is a swan (sentence 6), and greg is also a swan (sentence 8), it can be inferred that julius and greg share similar characteristics as they belong to the same species. additionally, sentence 9 states that greg is yellow. therefore, it is logical to assume that julius, being a swan like greg, is also yellow.	fully	Not mentioned	False	The question asks about the color of Julius, who is described as a swan in sentence 6. Since swans are not typically associated with a specific color, we need to look for any additional information that might help us determine the color of Julius. However, there is no mention of Julius's color in the given context sentences.		"Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Julius, who is described as a swan in sentence 6.
