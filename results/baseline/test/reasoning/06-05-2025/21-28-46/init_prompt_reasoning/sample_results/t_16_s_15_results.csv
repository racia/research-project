Here are the context sentences:
1. Bernhard is a rhino.
2. Bernhard is gray.
3. Brian is a rhino.
4. Brian is white.
5. Lily is a rhino.
6. Greg is a frog.
7. Greg is green.
8. Julius is a rhino.
9. Julius is yellow.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	yellow	since there is no direct information about lily's color, we need to make an inference. we know that bernhard, brian, and julius are all rhinos, and each of them has a different color (gray, white, and yellow, respectively). there is no pattern or correlation between the names and the colors. therefore, the most logical assumption is that lily, being a rhino, has a color that is not mentioned yet for any other rhino. the only remaining color	fully	Not mentioned	False	The question asks about the color of Lily, and since Lily is a rhino (from sentence 5), we can infer that Lily's color is not mentioned in the given context. However, we can look for any information about Lily's color in the context sentences. Since Lily is not mentioned again in any of the sentences, we cannot find any specific information about Lily's color.
