1. The blue square is above the pink rectangle.
2. The blue square is below the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square above the pink rectangle?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the blue square is above the pink rectangle. from context sentence 2, we know that the blue square is below the red square. since the blue square is above the pink rectangle and below the red square, we can logically conclude that the red square must be above the pink rectangle.	fully	yes	True	Since the blue square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 1), and the blue square is below the red square (sentence 2), we can infer that the red square is above the blue square. Since the blue square is above the pink rectangle, the red square must also be above the pink rectangle.
