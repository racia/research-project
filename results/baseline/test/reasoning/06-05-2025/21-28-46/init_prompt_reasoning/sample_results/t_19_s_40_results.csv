Here are the context sentences:
1. The garden is west of the office.
2. The hallway is south of the bedroom.
3. The kitchen is north of the bedroom.
4. The bedroom is east of the office.
5. The kitchen is south of the bathroom.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the office to the kitchen?"	east north	from the context sentences, we know the relative positions of the office, bedroom, and kitchen. specifically, sentence 4 states that the bedroom is east of the office, and sentence 3 states that the kitchen is north of the bedroom. therefore, to go from the office to the kitchen, we need to move east from the office to reach the bedroom, and then move north from the bedroom to reach the kitchen. hence, the correct direction is east north.	fully		False	Since the office is west of the garden (sentence 1), and the kitchen is north of the bedroom (sentence 3), we can infer that the office is west of the bedroom. Since the bedroom is east of the office (sentence 4), we can conclude that the office is not directly adjacent to the kitchen. However, the kitchen is south of the bathroom (sentence 5), and the bedroom is east of the office. Therefore, we can go from the office		Reasoning: Since the office is west of the garden (sentence 1), and the kitchen is north of the bedroom (sentence 3), we can infer that the office is west of the bedroom. Since the bedroom is east of the office (sentence 4), we can conclude that the office is not directly adjacent to the kitchen. However, the kitchen is south of the bathroom (sentence 5), and the bedroom is east of the office. Therefore, we can go from the office	0.1515	0.0202	False	False	False	False	0
