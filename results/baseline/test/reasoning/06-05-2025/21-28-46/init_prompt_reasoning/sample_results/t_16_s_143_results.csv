Here are the context sentences:
1. Brian is a rhino.
2. Lily is a frog.
3. Bernhard is a frog.
4. Brian is yellow.
5. Lily is gray.
6. Julius is a swan.
7. Greg is a swan.
8. Bernhard is gray.
9. Greg is gray.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Julius?"	gray	since julius is a swan (sentence 6), and greg is also a swan (sentence 7), we can infer that they share similar characteristics. sentence 9 states that greg is gray, so it is logical to assume that julius, being of the same species, also shares this characteristic, i.e., being gray.	fully		False	The question asks about the color of Julius, who is described as a swan in sentence 6. Since swans are not mentioned as having a specific color, we need to look for any information that might relate to Julius' color. However, there is no direct mention of Julius' color in the given sentences. We can try to find a connection between Julius and another entity that has a color mentioned. Sentence 6 mentions Julius as a swan, and sentence 6		Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Julius, who is described as a swan in sentence 6.
