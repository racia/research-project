2. The suitcase is bigger than the box of chocolates.
3. The box is bigger than the chocolate.
4. The chest is bigger than the box of chocolates.
5. The container is bigger than the chocolate.

Now, answer the following question:
Does the container fit in the chocolate?"	no	from context sentence 1, we know the box fits inside the container. from context sentence 3, we know the box is bigger than the chocolate. if the box is bigger than the chocolate, it means the chocolate is smaller than the box. since the box fits inside the container (sentence 1), the container must be bigger than the box. therefore, the container is also bigger than the chocolate (transitive property). hence, the container cannot fit inside the chocolate, which	fully	Not mentioned	False	The question asks if the container fits in the chocolate. However, the context sentences do not provide any information about the size of the chocolate. Sentence 3 states that the box is bigger than the chocolate, but it does not provide a size comparison between the container and the chocolate. Therefore, we cannot determine if the container fits in the chocolate based on the given information.		"Reasoning: The question asks if the container fits in the chocolate.
