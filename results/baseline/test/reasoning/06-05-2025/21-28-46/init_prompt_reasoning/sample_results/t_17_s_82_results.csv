Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is below the pink rectangle.
2. The triangle is to the left of the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the right of the red square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is below the pink rectangle (sentence 1) and to the left of the red square (sentence 2). since the triangle is to the left of the red square, it means the red square is to the right of the triangle. now, considering the triangle is below the pink rectangle, the pink rectangle must be above the triangle. therefore, the pink rectangle is also to the left of the red square, not to the right	fully	unknown	False	Since the triangle is below the pink rectangle, it means the pink rectangle is above the triangle. Also, the triangle is to the left of the red square, which means the red square is to the right of the triangle. However, there is no direct information about the relation between the pink rectangle and the red square.
