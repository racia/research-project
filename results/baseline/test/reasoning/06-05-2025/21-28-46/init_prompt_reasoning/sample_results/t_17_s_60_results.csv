Here are the context sentences:
1. The yellow square is to the right of the red square.
2. The yellow square is below the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square to the right of the red square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is to the right of the red square (sentence 1) and the yellow square is below the blue square (sentence 2). since the yellow square is below the blue square, it means the blue square is above the yellow square. now, we can use the information from sentence 1, which states that the yellow square is to the right of the red square. therefore, if the blue square is above the yellow square	fully	No	False	The question asks about the relation between the blue square and the red square. We know that the yellow square is to the right of the red square (sentence 1). Since the yellow square is below the blue square (sentence 2), we can infer that the blue square is not necessarily to the right of the red square. The yellow square's position relative to the red square does not provide information about the blue square's position relative to the red square.
