Here are the context sentences:
1. The yellow square is to the right of the blue square.
2. The blue square is above the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square above the triangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is to the right of the blue square (sentence 1), and the blue square is above the triangle (sentence 2). since the yellow square is to the right of the blue square, and the blue square is above the triangle, we can logically conclude that the yellow square is also above the triangle. therefore, the answer is yes, the yellow square is above the triangle.	fully	unknown	False	The yellow square is to the right of the blue square, but there is no information about the vertical position of the yellow square relative to the triangle. The blue square is above the triangle, but this does not provide any information about the yellow square's position.		"Reasoning: The yellow square is to the right of the blue square, but there is no information about the vertical position of the yellow square relative to the triangle. The blue square is above the triangle, but this does not provide any information about the yellow square's position.
