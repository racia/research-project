Here are the context sentences:
1. The yellow square is to the left of the blue square.
2. The red square is below the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square above the blue square?"	no	"from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is to the left of the blue square (sentence 1), and the red square is below the yellow square (sentence 2). this means that the red square is not above the blue square, but rather below the yellow square, which is to the left of the blue square. therefore, the correct answer is ""no"", the red square is not above the blue square."	fully	no	True	The question asks if the red square is above the blue square. We know the red square is below the yellow square (from sentence 2). We also know the yellow square is to the left of the blue square (from sentence 1). Since the red square is below the yellow square, it cannot be above the blue square.		"Reasoning: The question asks if the red square is above the blue square.
