Here are the context sentences:
1. The chest is bigger than the chocolate.
2. The box of chocolates fits inside the chest.
3. The suitcase is bigger than the chocolate.
4. The suitcase fits inside the chest.
5. The box of chocolates fits inside the box.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the chest bigger than the chocolate?"	yes	"from context sentence 1, we directly know that ""the chest is bigger than the chocolate."" this sentence explicitly states the comparison between the chest and the chocolate, and it clearly indicates that the chest is bigger. therefore, the answer to the question ""is the chest bigger than the chocolate?"" is indeed ""yes""."	fully		False	The context sentences provide information about the relationships between the chest, the chocolate, the box of chocolates, and the suitcase. Sentence 1 states that the chest is bigger than the chocolate, which implies that the chest has a larger size or capacity than the chocolate. Sentences 2 and 4 provide additional information about the relationships between the chest and the box of chocolates, and the suitcase, respectively. However, these sentences do not contradict the initial statement in sentence 1.

Now, answer the following question:
Does the chocolate fit in the chest?"	yes	"from context sentence 2, we know that ""the box of chocolates fits inside the chest."" although the question asks about a single chocolate, we can logically infer that if a box of chocolates fits inside the chest, then a single chocolate would also fit inside the chest. therefore, the answer to the question ""does the chocolate fit in the chest?"" is indeed ""yes""."	none	yes	True	Sentence 2 states that the box of chocolates fits inside the chest, which implies that the chest has a larger size or capacity than the box of chocolates. Since the chocolate is smaller than the box of chocolates (as it is a single piece of chocolate), it is likely that the chocolate also fits inside the chest.
