Here are the context sentences:
1. The chocolate fits inside the box.
2. The container is bigger than the box.
3. The suitcase is bigger than the box of chocolates.
4. The suitcase is bigger than the box of chocolates.
5. The box is bigger than the box of chocolates.

Now, answer the following question:
Does the chocolate fit in the container?"	yes	"from sentence 1, we know the chocolate fits inside the box. sentence 2 states that the container is bigger than the box. this implies that the container is also bigger than the chocolate (since the chocolate fits inside the box). therefore, the chocolate will fit inside the container, which is the answer ""yes""."	fully	yes	True	Since the container is bigger than the box (sentence 2), and the box is bigger than the box of chocolates (sentence 5), it implies that the container is also bigger than the box of chocolates. Since the chocolate fits inside the box (sentence 1), it is logical to infer that the chocolate will also fit inside the container, which is bigger than the box.		"Reasoning: Since the container is bigger than the box (sentence 2), and the box is bigger than the box of chocolates (sentence 5), it implies that the container is also bigger than the box of chocolates. Since the chocolate fits inside the box (sentence 1), it is logical to infer that the chocolate will also fit inside the container, which is bigger than the box.
