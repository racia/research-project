Here are the context sentences:
1. Julius is a swan.
2. Brian is a rhino.
3. Julius is yellow.
4. Lily is a frog.
5. Greg is a frog.
6. Brian is green.
7. Bernhard is a rhino.
8. Bernhard is gray.
9. Greg is green.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	green	since lily is a frog (sentence 4), and greg is also a frog (sentence 5), it can be inferred that they share similar characteristics. sentence 9 states that greg is green, so it is logical to assume that lily, being a frog like greg, is also green.	fully	Not mentioned	False	The question asks about the color of Lily, who is a frog according to sentence 4. Since the color of Lily is not mentioned in the given context sentences, we need to infer it logically. However, there is no information about the color of frogs in the given context sentences. Therefore, we cannot determine the color of Lily based on the provided information.		"Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Lily, who is a frog according to sentence 4.
