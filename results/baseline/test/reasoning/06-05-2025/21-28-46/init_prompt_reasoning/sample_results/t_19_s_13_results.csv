1. The kitchen is west of the bedroom.
2. The garden is east of the bathroom.
3. The office is north of the bathroom.
4. The bathroom is east of the hallway.
5. The bathroom is north of the bedroom.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the bathroom to the kitchen?"	south west	from sentence 5, we know the bathroom is north of the bedroom. from sentence 1, we know the kitchen is west of the bedroom. therefore, to go from the bathroom to the kitchen, we need to move south (to reach the bedroom) and then west (to reach the kitchen). hence, the correct direction is south west.	fully	west	False	Since the bathroom is east of the hallway (sentence 4), and the kitchen is west of the bedroom (sentence 1), we can infer that the bathroom is also east of the bedroom. Since the bathroom is north of the bedroom (sentence 5), we can conclude that to go from the bathroom to the kitchen, we need to move west.
