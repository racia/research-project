Here are the context sentences:
1. Julius is a rhino.
2. Brian is a frog.
3. Julius is yellow.
4. Brian is green.
5. Lily is a swan.
6. Greg is a rhino.
7. Bernhard is a frog.
8. Lily is white.
9. Bernhard is gray.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	yellow	since greg is a rhino (sentence 6), and julius is also a rhino (sentence 1) and is yellow (sentence 3), we can logically infer that greg, being of the same species as julius, shares the same color, which is yellow.	fully	yellow	True	Since Greg is a rhino (sentence 6), and Julius is also a rhino (sentence 1), we can infer that Greg's color is not specified in the given context. However, Julius's color is yellow (sentence 3), which is not a characteristic that can be directly applied to Greg. Therefore, we need to look for another clue.
