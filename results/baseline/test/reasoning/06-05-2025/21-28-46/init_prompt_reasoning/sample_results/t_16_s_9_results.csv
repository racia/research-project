Here are the context sentences:
1. Lily is a rhino.
2. Greg is a lion.
3. Brian is a lion.
4. Bernhard is a frog.
5. Julius is a swan.
6. Lily is green.
7. Julius is gray.
8. Brian is gray.
9. Bernhard is green.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	gray	since greg is a lion (sentence 2), and brian is also a lion (sentence 3), it can be inferred that greg and brian share similar characteristics. sentence 8 states that brian is gray, so it is logical to assume that greg, being a lion like brian, is also gray.	fully	Gray	True	The question asks about the color of Greg, who is a lion according to sentence 2. Since the color of a lion is not mentioned in the given context, we need to infer it logically. We can do this by comparing the colors of other animals that are similar to lions, such as Brian, who is also a lion and is gray according to sentence 8. This suggests that lions are likely to be gray.		"Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Greg, who is a lion according to sentence 2.
