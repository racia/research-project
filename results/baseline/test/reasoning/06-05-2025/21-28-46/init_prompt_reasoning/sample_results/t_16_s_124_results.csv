Here are the context sentences:
1. Greg is a swan.
2. Julius is a frog.
3. Lily is a swan.
4. Greg is white.
5. Bernhard is a frog.
6. Lily is white.
7. Bernhard is yellow.
8. Brian is a swan.
9. Brian is gray.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Julius?"	yellow	since julius is a frog (sentence 2), and bernhard is also a frog (sentence 5), we can infer that julius and bernhard share similar characteristics as they belong to the same species. additionally, sentence 7 states that bernhard is yellow. therefore, it is logical to assume that julius, being a frog like bernhard, also shares the same color, which is yellow.	fully	Not mentioned	False	The question asks about the color of Julius, who is a frog according to sentence 2. Since frogs are not typically associated with a specific color, we need to look for any information that might provide a hint. However, there is no mention of Julius's color in the given sentences. Therefore, we can infer that Julius's color is not mentioned.		"Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Julius, who is a frog according to sentence 2.
