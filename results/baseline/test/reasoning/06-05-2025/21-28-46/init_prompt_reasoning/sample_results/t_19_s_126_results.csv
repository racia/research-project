1. The bathroom is north of the office.
2. The kitchen is south of the garden.
3. The bedroom is south of the office.
4. The hallway is east of the garden.
5. The garden is east of the office.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the kitchen to the office?"	north west	from the context sentences, we know that the kitchen is south of the garden (sentence 2), and the garden is east of the office (sentence 5). to go from the kitchen to the office, we need to move in a direction that is opposite to south (which is north) and opposite to east (which is west). therefore, we need to move northwest to go from the kitchen to the office.	fully	east	False	Since the kitchen is south of the garden (sentence 2), and the garden is east of the office (sentence 5), we can infer that the office is east of the kitchen. Additionally, the bathroom is north of the office (sentence 1), which means the office is not north of the kitchen. Combining these inferences, we can conclude that the office is east of the kitchen.
