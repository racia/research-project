Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is below the red square.
2. The pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the left of the red square?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red sphere is below the red square. from context sentence 2, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere. since the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere, and the red sphere is below the red square, we can logically conclude that the pink rectangle is to the left of the red square.	fully	yes	True	The question asks about the relation between the pink rectangle and the red square. Since the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere (which is below the red square), we need to consider the spatial relationships between these objects. The red sphere is below the red square, which means the pink rectangle (to the left of the red sphere) is also to the left of the red square.
