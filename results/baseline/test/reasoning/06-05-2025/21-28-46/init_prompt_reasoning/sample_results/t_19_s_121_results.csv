Here are the context sentences:
1. The office is south of the hallway.
2. The bathroom is north of the hallway.
3. The bedroom is south of the kitchen.
4. The garden is east of the hallway.
5. The bedroom is west of the bathroom.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the bedroom to the hallway?"	east south	from sentence 5, we know that the bedroom is west of the bathroom. from sentence 2, we know that the bathroom is north of the hallway. therefore, to go from the bedroom to the hallway, we need to move east (to reach the bathroom) and then south (to reach the hallway). hence, the correct direction is east south.	fully	west	False	Since the bedroom is west of the bathroom (sentence 5), and the bathroom is north of the hallway (sentence 2), we can conclude that the bedroom is also west of the hallway. Additionally, the bedroom is south of the kitchen (sentence 3), and the hallway is east of the garden (sentence 4). This information doesn't provide a direct path from the bedroom to the hallway, but it helps us understand the relative positions of the entities.
