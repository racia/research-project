2. Greg is a swan.
3. Julius is a swan.
4. Greg is gray.
5. Julius is gray.
6. Bernhard is a lion.
7. Lily is a swan.
8. Bernhard is green.
9. Brian is white.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	gray	since there is no direct information about lily's color, we need to make an inference. we know that greg and julius are both swans and gray ( sentences 4 and 5). we also know that brian is a swan but white (sentence 9). this suggests that being a swan does not necessarily determine the color. however, since two out of three swans mentioned (greg and julius) are gray, it is a logical assumption to make that lily, being	fully	gray	True	The question asks about the color of Lily, who is a swan according to sentence 7. Since Brian, Greg, and Julius are all swans and are gray (sentences 4, 5), it is likely that Lily, being a swan, is also gray.		"Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Lily, who is a swan according to sentence 7. Since Brian, Greg, and Julius are all swans and are gray (sentences 4, 5), it is likely that Lily, being a swan, is also gray.
