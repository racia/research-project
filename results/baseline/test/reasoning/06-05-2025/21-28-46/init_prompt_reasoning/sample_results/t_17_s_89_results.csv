1. The red sphere is to the right of the yellow square.
2. The yellow square is below the pink rectangle.

Is the pink rectangle to the right of the red sphere?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the red sphere is to the right of the yellow square (sentence 1), and the yellow square is below the pink rectangle (sentence 2). since the yellow square is below the pink rectangle, it means the pink rectangle is above the yellow square. now, if the pink rectangle is above the yellow square, and the red sphere is to the right of the yellow square, then the pink rectangle cannot be to the right of the red sphere	fully		False	The question asks about the relative position of the pink rectangle and the red sphere. Since the yellow square is below the pink rectangle (sentence 2), it means the pink rectangle is above the yellow square. However, the question is asking about the pink rectangle's position relative to the red sphere, which is to the right of the yellow square (sentence 1).
