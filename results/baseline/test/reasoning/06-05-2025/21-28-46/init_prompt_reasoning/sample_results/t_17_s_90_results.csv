Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is above the pink rectangle.
2. The pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere to the left of the blue square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the blue square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 1), and the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere (sentence 2). since the blue square is above the pink rectangle, and the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere, we can infer that the blue square is not to the left of the red sphere. in fact, the blue square is above the pink rectangle, which is to the left of the	fully	no	True	The blue square is above the pink rectangle, and the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere.
