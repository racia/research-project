Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is below the red sphere.
2. The red sphere is below the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle above the red square?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red square is below the red sphere. from context sentence 2, we know that the red sphere is below the triangle. therefore, we can logically conclude that the triangle is above the red sphere, and since the red sphere is above the red square, the triangle must be above the red square.	fully	yes	True	The triangle is above the red sphere, and the red sphere is above the red square. This implies that the triangle is above the red square.		"Reasoning: The triangle is above the red sphere, and the red sphere is above the red square. This implies that the triangle is above the red square.
