However, the suitcase is bigger than the box (sentence 2), which means the box is smaller than the suitcase. Since the box is bigger than the box of chocolates (sentence 4), the box of chocolates is smaller than the box. Therefore, the container, which is larger than the suitcase, cannot fit inside the box.
