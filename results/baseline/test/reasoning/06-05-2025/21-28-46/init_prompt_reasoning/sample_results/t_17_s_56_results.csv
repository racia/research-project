1. The triangle is to the right of the blue square.
2. The triangle is to the left of the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle above the blue square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is to the right of the blue square (sentence 1) and to the left of the pink rectangle (sentence 2). this implies that the triangle is between the blue square and the pink rectangle. since the triangle is to the right of the blue square, the pink rectangle must be to the right of the triangle, and therefore to the right of the blue square as well. there is no information provided about the vertical positions of	fully	unknown	False	Since the triangle is to the right of the blue square, it implies that the blue square is on the left side. Also, the triangle is to the left of the pink rectangle, which implies that the pink rectangle is on the right side. There is no information about the vertical position of the blue square and the pink rectangle. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether the pink rectangle is above or below the blue square.
