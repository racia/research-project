Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is above the red square.
2. The red square is to the left of the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the right of the blue square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the blue square is above the red square (sentence 1), and the red square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 2). since the blue square is above the red square, and the red square is to the left of the triangle, we can logically conclude that the triangle is to the right of the blue square.	fully	yes	True	The triangle is to the right of the red square (from sentence 2), and the red square is to the left of the blue square (from sentence 1). This means that the triangle is not directly above or below the blue square. However, since the red square is to the left of the blue square, the triangle must be to the right of the blue square.
