Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere.
2. The yellow square is above the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square above the red sphere?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere (sentence 1). we also know that the yellow square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 2). since the yellow square is above the pink rectangle, and the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere, we can logically conclude that the yellow square is above the red sphere.	fully	Not mentioned	False	The question asks about the relation between the yellow square and the red sphere. To answer this, we need to consider the positions of these two entities relative to each other. From sentence 1, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere. Sentence 2 tells us that the yellow square is above the pink rectangle. However, there is no direct information about the position of the yellow square relative to the red sphere.
