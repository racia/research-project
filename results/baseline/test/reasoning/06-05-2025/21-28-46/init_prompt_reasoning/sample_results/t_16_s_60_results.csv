Here are the context sentences:
1. Brian is a frog.
2. Brian is white.
3. Lily is a lion.
4. Julius is a lion.
5. Julius is white.
6. Greg is a swan.
7. Greg is white.
8. Lily is white.
9. Bernhard is a frog.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Bernhard?"	white	since bernhard is a frog (sentence 9), and we know that brian is also a frog (sentence 1) and is white (sentence 2), it is logical to assume that bernhard, being a frog as well, shares the same characteristic of being white. this inference is based on the pattern observed in the context sentences, where all the frogs mentioned (brian and bernhard) are white.	fully	White	True	Since Bernhard is a frog (from sentence 9), and Brian is also a frog (from sentence 1), we can infer that Bernhard's color is likely to be similar to Brian's color, which is white (from sentence 2).		"Reasoning: Since Bernhard is a frog (from sentence 9), and Brian is also a frog (from sentence 1), we can infer that Bernhard's color is likely to be similar to Brian's color, which is white (from sentence 2).
