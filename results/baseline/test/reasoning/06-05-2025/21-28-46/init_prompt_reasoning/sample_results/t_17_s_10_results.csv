1. The blue square is below the yellow square.
2. The red sphere is below the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square below the red sphere?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the blue square is below the yellow square (sentence 1), and the red sphere is below the blue square (sentence 2). this means that the red sphere is below the blue square, and the blue square is below the yellow square. therefore, the yellow square is above the blue square, and the blue square is above the red sphere. as a result, the yellow square cannot be below the red sphere.	fully	no	True	The blue square is below the yellow square, and the red sphere is below the blue square. This implies that the blue square is between the yellow square and the red sphere. Since the blue square is below the yellow square, it means that the yellow square is above the blue square. Therefore, the yellow square cannot be below the red sphere.		"Reasoning: The blue square is below the yellow square, and the red sphere is below the blue square.
