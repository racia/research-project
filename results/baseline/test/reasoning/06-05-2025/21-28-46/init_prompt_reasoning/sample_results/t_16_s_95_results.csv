Here are the context sentences:
1. Brian is a swan.
2. Julius is a rhino.
3. Lily is a frog.
4. Greg is a rhino.
5. Lily is gray.
6. Bernhard is a frog.
7. Bernhard is gray.
8. Julius is yellow.
9. Brian is green.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	yellow	since greg is a rhino (from context sentence 4), and julius is also a rhino (from context sentence 2), we can infer that greg and julius share the same characteristics. additionally, we know that julius is yellow (from context sentence 8). therefore, it is logical to assume that greg, being a rhino like julius, is also yellow.	fully	gray	False	Since Greg is a rhino (sentence 4), and Julius, who is also a rhino, is yellow (sentence 8), it's likely that Greg's color is not mentioned in the context sentences. However, since Lily, who is a different type of animal (frog), is gray (sentence 5), it's possible that Greg's color is also gray, but there's no direct evidence to support this.
