Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is below the triangle.
2. The pink rectangle is to the left of the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle above the pink rectangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the red square is below the triangle (sentence 1). we also know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the red square (sentence 2). since the pink rectangle is to the left of the red square, and the red square is below the triangle, it logically follows that the triangle is above the pink rectangle.	fully	yes	True	Since the red square is below the triangle, it implies that the triangle is above the red square. Additionally, the pink rectangle is to the left of the red square, which means it is not directly related to the triangle's position. Therefore, we can conclude that the triangle's position is not affected by the pink rectangle's position.
