Here are the context sentences:
1. Greg is a rhino.
2. Julius is a lion.
3. Lily is a swan.
4. Julius is green.
5. Lily is white.
6. Bernhard is a frog.
7. Greg is yellow.
8. Bernhard is gray.
9. Brian is a lion.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Brian?"	green	since brian is a lion (sentence 9), and julius is also a lion (sentence 2), and julius is green (sentence 4), we can logically infer that brian, being of the same species as julius, shares the same color, which is green.	fully		False	The question asks about the color of Brian, who is a lion according to sentence 9. Since Julius, who is also a lion, is green (sentence 4), it is possible that Brian's color is also green. However, there is no direct information about Brian's color in the given sentences. The only information about Brian's color is that Julius, a lion, is green, but this does not necessarily imply that Brian, another lion, has the same color.		Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Brian, who is a lion according to sentence 9. Since Julius, who is also a lion, is green (sentence 4), it is possible that Brian's color is also green. However, there is no direct information about Brian's color in the given sentences. The only information about Brian's color is that Julius, a lion, is green, but this does not necessarily imply that Brian, another lion, has the same color.	0.0404	0.0303	False	False	False	True	0
