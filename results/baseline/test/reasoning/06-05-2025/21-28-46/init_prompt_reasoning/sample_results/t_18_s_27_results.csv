Here are the context sentences:
1. The suitcase fits inside the container.
2. The box of chocolates is bigger than the chocolate.
3. The container is bigger than the chocolate.
4. The chest is bigger than the chocolate.
5. The chest is bigger than the box of chocolates.

Now, answer the following question:
Does the chocolate fit in the chest?"	yes	from context sentence 2, we know the box of chocolates is bigger than the chocolate. from context sentence 5, we know the chest is bigger than the box of chocolates. therefore, we can logically conclude that the chest is bigger than the chocolate. since the chest is bigger than the chocolate, it is possible for the chocolate to fit inside the chest.	fully	yes	True	The context sentences provide information about the sizes of the suitcase, container, box of chocolates, chocolate, and chest. From these sentences, we can infer that the chocolate is the smallest object, and the chest is the largest object. Since the chest is bigger than the chocolate, it is logical to conclude that the chocolate fits inside the chest.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the chocolate bigger than the chest?"	no	from the answer, we know that the chocolate is not bigger than the chest. this implies that the chest is either bigger than or equal to the chocolate in size. since we don't have any information suggesting the chocolate is equal in size to the chest, it is logical to assume that the chest is bigger than the chocolate.	none	no	True	The context sentences explicitly state that the chest is bigger than the chocolate (sentence 4).
