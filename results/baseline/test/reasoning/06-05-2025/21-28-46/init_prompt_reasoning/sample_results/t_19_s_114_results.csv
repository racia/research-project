1. The bathroom is south of the office.
2. The garden is west of the office.
3. The bedroom is east of the office.
4. The kitchen is north of the office.
5. The bedroom is west of the hallway.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the office to the hallway?"	east east	from the context sentences, we know the relative positions of the office, bedroom, and hallway. sentence 3 states that the bedroom is east of the office, and sentence 5 states that the bedroom is west of the hallway. therefore, to go from the office to the hallway, we need to move east from the office to reach the bedroom, and then continue moving east to reach the hallway. hence, the correct direction is east east.	fully	east	True	Since the bedroom is east of the office, it implies that the office is not directly adjacent to the hallway. Also, the bedroom is west of the hallway, which means the hallway is east of the bedroom. Combining these two pieces of information, we can conclude that the office is west of the hallway.
