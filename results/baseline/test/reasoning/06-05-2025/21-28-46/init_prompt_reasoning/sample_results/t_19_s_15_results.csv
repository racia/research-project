1. The office is north of the hallway.
2. The kitchen is east of the bedroom.
3. The office is west of the garden.
4. The bedroom is north of the garden.
5. The bedroom is south of the bathroom.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the bedroom to the office?"	south west	from sentence 4, we know the bedroom is north of the garden. from sentence 3, we know the office is west of the garden. therefore, to go from the bedroom to the office, we need to go south (to reach the garden) and then west (to reach the office). hence, the correct direction is south west.	fully	east, north	False	Since the bedroom is north of the garden (sentence 4), and the office is north of the hallway (sentence 1), we can infer that the office is also north of the bedroom. Additionally, the office is west of the garden (sentence 3), which means it is not directly north of the bedroom. Therefore, we need to move east from the bedroom to the hallway, and then north to reach the office.
