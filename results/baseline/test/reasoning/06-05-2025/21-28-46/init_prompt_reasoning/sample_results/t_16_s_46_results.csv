6. Brian is a lion.
7. Bernhard is yellow.
8. Lily is white.
9. Brian is white.

What color is Greg?"	yellow	since greg is a frog (sentence 3), and julius is also a frog (sentence 1) and is yellow (sentence 4), it can be logically inferred that greg, being of the same species as julius, is also likely to be yellow. this is the most reasonable assumption based on the provided information, as there is no other color mentioned in relation to frogs.	fully	yellow	True	The question asks about the color of Greg, who is mentioned in sentence 3 as a frog.
