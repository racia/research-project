Here are the context sentences:
1. Brian is a lion.
2. Julius is a frog.
3. Julius is yellow.
4. Lily is a frog.
5. Lily is yellow.
6. Bernhard is a frog.
7. Brian is white.
8. Bernhard is yellow.
9. Greg is a lion.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	white	since greg is a lion (from context sentence 9), and we know that brian is also a lion (from context sentence 1) and is white (from context sentence 7), we can logically infer that greg, being a lion like brian, is also white.	fully	yellow	False	The question asks about the color of Greg, who is a lion according to sentence 9. Since Julius, who is also a lion, is gray (not mentioned in the context), we cannot infer the color of Greg from Julius. However, Bernhard, who is also a lion, is yellow (sentence 8). Since there is no information contradicting this, we can assume that Greg, being a lion, is also yellow.		"Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Greg, who is a lion according to sentence 9.
