Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is to the right of the blue square.
2. The red sphere is below the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the right of the blue square?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red sphere is to the right of the blue square. from context sentence 2, we know that the red sphere is below the red square. since the red sphere is to the right of the blue square and below the red square, it can be logically inferred that the red square is also to the right of the blue square, as the red sphere is below it and to the right of the blue square.	fully		False	The question asks about the relation between the red square and the blue square. We know that the red sphere is to the right of the blue square (from sentence 1). However, this information only tells us about the red sphere's position relative to the blue square, not the red square's position. We also know that the red sphere is below the red square (from sentence 2), which doesn't provide any information about the red square's position relative to the blue square		Reasoning: The question asks about the relation between the red square and the blue square.
