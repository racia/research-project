Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is above the red square.
2. The pink rectangle is to the right of the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square to the left of the red square?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know the pink rectangle is above the red square, which implies they are in the same vertical line. from context sentence 2, we know the pink rectangle is to the right of the blue square. since the pink rectangle is above the red square and to the right of the blue square, it means the blue square must be to the left of the red square.	fully		False	The question asks about the relation between the blue square and the red square. We know that the pink rectangle is to the right of the blue square (from sentence 2), but this information doesn't directly relate to the blue square's position relative to the red square. We also know that the pink rectangle is above the red square (from sentence 1), but this doesn't provide any information about the blue square's position relative to the red square either.
