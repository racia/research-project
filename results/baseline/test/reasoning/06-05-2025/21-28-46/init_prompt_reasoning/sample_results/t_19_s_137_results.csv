Here are the context sentences:
1. The bedroom is east of the hallway.
2. The garden is south of the bedroom.
3. The office is east of the kitchen.
4. The bathroom is west of the kitchen.
5. The bedroom is south of the kitchen.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the bedroom to the bathroom?"	north west	from context sentence 5, we know that the bedroom is south of the kitchen. this implies that the kitchen is north of the bedroom. from context sentence 4, we know that the bathroom is west of the kitchen. therefore, to go from the bedroom to the bathroom, we need to go in a northwestern direction, which is a combination of north (to reach the kitchen) and west (to reach the bathroom from the kitchen).	fully		False	Since the bedroom is east of the hallway, it implies that the bedroom is not adjacent to the bathroom, which is west of the kitchen. Also, the bedroom is south of the kitchen, which means the bathroom is north of the kitchen. To go from the bedroom to the bathroom, we need to move west from the bedroom, which is not possible directly. We need to move north from the bedroom to reach the kitchen, and then west from the kitchen to reach the bathroom.		Reasoning: Since the bedroom is east of the hallway, it implies that the bedroom is not adjacent to the bathroom, which is west of the kitchen. Also, the bedroom is south of the kitchen, which means the bathroom is north of the kitchen. To go from the bedroom to the bathroom, we need to move west from the bedroom, which is not possible directly. We need to move north from the bedroom to reach the kitchen, and then west from the kitchen to reach the bathroom.	0.1616	0.0202	False	False	False	False	0
