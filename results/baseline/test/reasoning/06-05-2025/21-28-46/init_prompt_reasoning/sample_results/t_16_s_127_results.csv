4. Greg is green.
5. Bernhard is green.
6. Julius is a rhino.
7. Brian is a swan.
8. Julius is green.
9. Brian is green.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	green	since lily is a frog (sentence 2), and greg is also a frog (sentence 3) and is green (sentence 4), it can be logically inferred that frogs are green. therefore, lily, being a frog, is also green.	fully	Not mentioned	False	The question asks about the color of Lily, a frog.

We can infer that Lily's color is not mentioned because if it were, it would be mentioned in one of the sentences.		"Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Lily, a frog.
