1. The red sphere is above the blue square.
2. The red sphere is to the right of the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square below the blue square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the red sphere is above the blue square (sentence 1) and the red sphere is to the right of the yellow square (sentence 2). since the red sphere is above the blue square, it means the blue square is below the red sphere. if the yellow square were below the blue square, it would mean the yellow square is also below the red sphere. however, sentence 2 states that the red sphere is to the right of	fully	Not mentioned	False	The context sentences do not provide any information about the relative position of the yellow square and the blue square in terms of vertical direction.
