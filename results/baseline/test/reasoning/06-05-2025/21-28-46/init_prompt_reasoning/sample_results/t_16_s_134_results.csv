Here are the context sentences:
1. Greg is a swan.
2. Bernhard is a lion.
3. Bernhard is green.
4. Lily is a rhino.
5. Brian is a swan.
6. Julius is a rhino.
7. Greg is yellow.
8. Lily is white.
9. Julius is white.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Brian?"	yellow	since brian is a swan (sentence 5), and greg is also a swan (sentence 1), it can be inferred that they share similar characteristics. additionally, greg is yellow (sentence 7), which suggests that being yellow might be a characteristic of swans. therefore, it is logical to assume that brian, being a swan, is also yellow.	fully	white	False	The question asks about the color of Brian, who is mentioned in sentence 5 as a swan. Since swans are typically white, and Brian is also mentioned alongside Greg, who is yellow, it is likely that Brian's color is also white. However, there is no direct mention of Brian's color in the context sentences. Therefore, we can infer that Brian is likely white based on the information provided.
