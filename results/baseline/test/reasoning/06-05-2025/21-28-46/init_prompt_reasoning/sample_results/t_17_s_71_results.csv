1. The yellow square is above the blue square.
2. The yellow square is to the left of the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square to the left of the triangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is above the blue square (sentence 1), which implies that the blue square is below the yellow square. we also know that the yellow square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 2). since the blue square is below the yellow square, it must also be to the left of the triangle, as the yellow square is blocking its way to the right. therefore, the blue square is indeed to the left of the	fully	no	False	The blue square is below the yellow square (from sentence 1), and the yellow square is to the left of the triangle (from sentence 2). Since the blue square is below the yellow square, it cannot be to the left of the triangle. The triangle's left side is occupied by the yellow square, which is above the blue square.
