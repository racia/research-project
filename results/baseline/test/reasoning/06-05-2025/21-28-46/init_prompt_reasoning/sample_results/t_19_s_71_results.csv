1. The garden is south of the hallway.
2. The bedroom is south of the kitchen.
3. The bathroom is south of the bedroom.
4. The hallway is east of the office.
5. The hallway is south of the bathroom.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the bedroom to the hallway?"	south south	from the context sentences, we know the relative positions of the rooms. sentence 2 states that the bedroom is south of the kitchen, and sentence 3 states that the bathroom is south of the bedroom. sentence 5 states that the hallway is south of the bathroom. therefore, to go from the bedroom to the hallway, we need to move south from the bedroom to the bathroom (since the bathroom is south of the bedroom) and then move south again from the bathroom to the hallway	fully	south	True	Since the bedroom is south of the kitchen (sentence 2), and the hallway is east of the office (sentence 4), we can infer that the hallway is not directly adjacent to the bedroom. However, sentence 5 states that the hallway is south of the bathroom, which is south of the bedroom (sentence 3). This implies that the hallway is south of the bedroom, not east or west.
