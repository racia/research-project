Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is to the left of the triangle.
2. The triangle is to the left of the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the right of the blue square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the red square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the left of the blue square (sentence 2). this means that the red square is to the left of the triangle, and the triangle is to the left of the blue square. therefore, the red square must be to the left of the blue square, not to the right of it.	fully	no	True	From sentence 1, we know the red square is to the left of the triangle. From sentence 2, we know the triangle is to the left of the blue square. This means the red square is to the left of the blue square, which implies it is not to the right of the blue square.
