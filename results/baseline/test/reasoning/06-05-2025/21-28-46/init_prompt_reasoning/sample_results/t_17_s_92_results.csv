1. The red square is to the right of the triangle.
2. The pink rectangle is below the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the left of the pink rectangle?"	yes	from the first context sentence, we know that the red square is to the right of the triangle. from the second context sentence, we know that the pink rectangle is below the red square. since the pink rectangle is below the red square, and the red square is to the right of the triangle, it logically follows that the triangle must be to the left of the pink rectangle.	fully	no	False	The triangle is to the left of the red square (from sentence 1). The pink rectangle is below the red square (from sentence 2). Since the pink rectangle is below the red square, it cannot be to the left of the triangle. The triangle's position relative to the pink rectangle is not specified, but we can conclude that the triangle is not to the left of the pink rectangle.
