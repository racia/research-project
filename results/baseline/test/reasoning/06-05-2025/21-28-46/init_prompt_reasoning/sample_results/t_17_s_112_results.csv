Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is to the left of the triangle.
2. The triangle is to the left of the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the right of the red sphere?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the red sphere is to the left of the triangle (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the left of the red square (sentence 2). by transitivity, we can conclude that the red sphere is to the left of the red square, which means the red square is to the right of the red sphere. therefore, the answer is yes.	fully	no	False	The question asks about the relative position of the red square and the red sphere. From the context sentences, we know that the triangle is to the left of the red square, and the red sphere is to the left of the triangle. This implies that the red sphere is to the left of the red square.		"Reasoning: The question asks about the relative position of the red square and the red sphere.
