Here are the context sentences:
1. Bernhard is a swan.
2. Greg is a frog.
3. Brian is a swan.
4. Julius is a lion.
5. Greg is gray.
6. Julius is yellow.
7. Lily is a lion.
8. Lily is green.
9. Brian is yellow.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Bernhard?"	yellow	since bernhard is a swan (context 1), and brian is also a swan (context 3), we can infer that bernhard and brian share similar characteristics. we know that brian is yellow (context 9), so it is logical to assume that bernhard, being the same type of animal, is also yellow.	fully	yellow	True	Since Bernhard is a swan, and swans are typically white, it is likely that Bernhard is white. However, there is no direct mention of Bernhard's color in the context sentences. We can infer Bernhard's color by considering the colors of other swans. Since Brian is also a swan and is yellow, it is possible that Bernhard is also yellow.		"Reasoning: Since Bernhard is a swan, and swans are typically white, it is likely that Bernhard is white.
