1. Bernhard is a lion.
2. Bernhard is green.
3. Brian is a lion.
4. Julius is a swan.
5. Lily is a frog.
6. Greg is a frog.
7. Lily is green.
8. Brian is yellow.
9. Julius is green.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	green	since greg is a frog (sentence 6), and lily is also a frog (sentence 5), we can infer that greg and lily share similar characteristics. we know that lily is green (sentence 7), so it is logical to assume that greg, being a fellow frog, is also green.	fully	green	True	Since Greg is a frog (from sentence 6), and Lily, who is also a frog, is green (from sentence 7), it is likely that Greg is also green, as frogs are often green. Additionally, there is no information that contradicts this assumption.		"Reasoning: Since Greg is a frog (from sentence 6), and Lily, who is also a frog, is green (from sentence 7), it is likely that Greg is also green, as frogs are often green. Additionally, there is no information that contradicts this assumption.
