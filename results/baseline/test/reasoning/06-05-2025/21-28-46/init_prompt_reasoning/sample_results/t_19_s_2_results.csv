1. The hallway is west of the bathroom.
2. The office is south of the bedroom.
3. The garden is north of the bedroom.
4. The kitchen is east of the bedroom.
5. The hallway is east of the kitchen.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the bedroom to the hallway?"	east east	from sentence 4, we know that the kitchen is east of the bedroom. from sentence 5, we know that the hallway is east of the kitchen. therefore, to go from the bedroom to the hallway, we need to go east from the bedroom to reach the kitchen, and then go east again from the kitchen to reach the hallway. hence, the correct direction is east east.	fully	west	False	Since the hallway is west of the bathroom, and the bedroom is north of the bedroom, we can infer that the bedroom is not directly adjacent to the hallway. However, we know that the hallway is east of the kitchen, and the bedroom is east of the garden. This suggests that the bedroom is likely to be adjacent to the east of the kitchen. Since the hallway is east of the kitchen, it is likely that the bedroom is west of the hallway.
