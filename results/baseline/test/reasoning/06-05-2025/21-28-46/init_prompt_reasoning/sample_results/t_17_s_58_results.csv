Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is to the right of the triangle.
2. The red sphere is above the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the left of the blue square?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red sphere is to the right of the triangle. from context sentence 2, we know that the red sphere is above the blue square. since the red sphere is above the blue square, it means the blue square is below the red sphere. now, if the red sphere is to the right of the triangle, and the blue square is below the red sphere, it logically follows that the triangle must be to the left of the blue	fully	yes	True	The triangle's position is not specified in relation to the blue square. However, we know the red sphere is above the blue square, and it is also to the right of the triangle. This information allows us to infer that the triangle is not above the blue square, as the red sphere is.
