Here are the context sentences:
1. Lily is a rhino.
2. Lily is white.
3. Bernhard is a swan.
4. Bernhard is yellow.
5. Greg is a swan.
6. Greg is white.
7. Brian is a swan.
8. Brian is green.
9. Julius is a rhino.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Julius?"	white	since julius is a rhino (sentence 9), and we know that lily is also a rhino (sentence 1) and is white (sentence 2), it is logical to assume that julius, being of the same species as lily, shares the same characteristic of being white.	fully	Gray	False	Since Julius is a rhino (sentence 1 and 9), and rhinos are typically gray, but there is no specific mention of Julius' color, we can infer that Julius is likely gray, as it is a common color for rhinos.		"Reasoning: Since Julius is a rhino (sentence 1 and 9), and rhinos are typically gray, but there is no specific mention of Julius' color, we can infer that Julius is likely gray, as it is a common color for rhinos.

Answer: Gray"	0.0862	0.0517	False	False	False	True	0
