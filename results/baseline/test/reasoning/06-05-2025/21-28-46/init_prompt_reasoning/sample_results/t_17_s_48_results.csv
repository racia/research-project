Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is to the right of the red sphere.
2. The triangle is above the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square to the right of the red sphere?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is to the right of the red sphere (sentence 1) and the triangle is above the blue square (sentence 2). since the triangle is above the blue square, it means the blue square is below the triangle. now, considering the triangle is to the right of the red sphere, we can logically conclude that the blue square, which is below the triangle, must also be to the right of the red sphere. therefore,	fully	yes	True	The question asks about the relative position of the blue square with respect to the red sphere. Since the triangle is above the blue square (sentence 2), it means the blue square is below the triangle. Also, the triangle is to the right of the red sphere (sentence 1). This implies that the blue square is also to the right of the red sphere, as it is below the triangle.
