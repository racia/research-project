Here are the context sentences:
1. Bernhard is a lion.
2. Lily is a lion.
3. Lily is yellow.
4. Greg is a rhino.
5. Bernhard is yellow.
6. Julius is a rhino.
7. Greg is green.
8. Brian is a frog.
9. Brian is white.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Julius?"	green	since julius is a rhino (sentence 6), and greg is also a rhino (sentence 4), we can infer that julius and greg share the same characteristics. we know that greg is green (sentence 7), so it is logical to assume that julius, being a rhino like greg, is also green.	fully		False	The question asks about the color of Julius, who is a rhino according to sentence 6. Since the color of a rhino is not mentioned, we need to look for a connection between Julius and a color. Sentence 5 mentions Bernhard, who is also a lion, and is yellow. Julius is not mentioned as being yellow, but Bernhard is. Therefore, we can infer that Julius's color is not mentioned, but Bernhard's color is yellow.		"Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Julius, who is a rhino according to sentence 6.
