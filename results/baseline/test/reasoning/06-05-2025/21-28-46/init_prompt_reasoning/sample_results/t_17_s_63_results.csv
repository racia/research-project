Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is to the left of the red sphere.
2. The red sphere is above the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square above the yellow square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the red square is to the left of the red sphere (sentence 1), and the red sphere is above the yellow square (sentence 2). since the red sphere is above the yellow square, and the red square is to the left of the red sphere, we can logically conclude that the red square is also above the yellow square.	fully	No	False	From sentence 1, we know the red square is to the left of the red sphere. From sentence 2, we know the red sphere is above the yellow square. However, there is no direct information about the red square's position relative to the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square below the red square?"	yes	since we previously established that the red square is above the yellow square (in the previous question), it logically follows that the yellow square is below the red square.	none	Unknown	False	We don't have any information about the yellow square's position relative to the red square.
