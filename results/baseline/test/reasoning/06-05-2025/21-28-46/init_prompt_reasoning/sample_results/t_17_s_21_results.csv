Here are the context sentences:
1. The yellow square is to the right of the red sphere.
2. The yellow square is to the left of the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the right of the red sphere?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is to the right of the red sphere (sentence 1) and to the left of the red square (sentence 2). this implies that the red sphere is to the left of the yellow square, and the red square is to the right of the yellow square. therefore, the red sphere is to the left of the yellow square, and the red square is to the right of the yellow square, which means the red square	fully		False	From sentence 1, we know the yellow square is to the right of the red sphere. From sentence 2, we know the yellow square is to the left of the red square. Since the yellow square is to the right of the red sphere, it means the red sphere is to the left of the yellow square. Now, we need to determine the position of the red square relative to the red sphere. Since the yellow square is to the left of the red square,		Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the yellow square is to the right of the red sphere.
