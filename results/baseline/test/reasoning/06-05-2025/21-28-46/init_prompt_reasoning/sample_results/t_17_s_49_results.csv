Here are the context sentences:
1. The yellow square is to the right of the blue square.
2. The yellow square is to the left of the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the left of the blue square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is to the right of the blue square (sentence 1) and to the left of the triangle (sentence 2). this means that the yellow square is between the blue square and the triangle. since the yellow square is to the right of the blue square, the triangle must be to the right of the yellow square, which in turn means that the triangle is to the right of the blue square. therefore, the triangle is	fully	no	True	Since the yellow square is to the right of the blue square, it means the blue square is to the left of the yellow square. Also, the yellow square is to the left of the triangle. This implies that the triangle is to the right of the blue square, not to the left.		"Reasoning: Since the yellow square is to the right of the blue square, it means the blue square is to the left of the yellow square. Also, the yellow square is to the left of the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle above the blue square?"	no	"there is no information provided about the vertical positions of the objects (blue square, yellow square, and triangle). the context sentences only mention the left-right relationships between them. therefore, we cannot conclude that the triangle is above or below the blue square. the answer ""no"" simply means that there is no evidence to suggest that the triangle is above the blue square, but it does not imply that it is below or at the same level as the blue square."	none	unknown	False	We don't have any information about the triangle's vertical position relative to the blue square.
