Here are the context sentences:
1. The kitchen is south of the office.
2. The bedroom is south of the bathroom.
3. The hallway is east of the kitchen.
4. The hallway is north of the bathroom.
5. The bathroom is east of the garden.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the bathroom to the kitchen?"	north west	"from sentence 4, we know the hallway is north of the bathroom. from sentence 3, we know the hallway is east of the kitchen. therefore, if we go north from the bathroom, we will reach the hallway, and then if we go west from the hallway, we will reach the kitchen. hence, to go from the bathroom to the kitchen, we need to go north and then west, which is represented as ""north west""."	fully	east	False	Since the bathroom is east of the garden (sentence 5), and the hallway is north of the bathroom (sentence 4), we can infer that the bathroom is not directly adjacent to the kitchen. However, the hallway is east of the kitchen (sentence 3), which means that we can go from the bathroom to the kitchen by going north to the hallway and then east to the kitchen.		"Reasoning: Since the bathroom is east of the garden (sentence 5), and the hallway is north of the bathroom (sentence 4), we can infer that the bathroom is not directly adjacent to the kitchen. However, the hallway is east of the kitchen (sentence 3), which means that we can go from the bathroom to the kitchen by going north to the hallway and then east to the kitchen.
