Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is below the blue square.
2. The red square is above the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square above the pink rectangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the blue square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 1) and the red square is above the blue square (sentence 2). therefore, we can logically conclude that the red square is above the pink rectangle, as it is above the blue square, which in turn is above the pink rectangle.	fully	yes	True	The pink rectangle is below the blue square, which means it is at a lower position than the blue square. The red square is above the blue square, which means it is at a higher position than the blue square. Since the pink rectangle is below the blue square, and the red square is above the blue square, the red square must be above the pink rectangle.
