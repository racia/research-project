Here are the context sentences:
1. Lily is a swan.
2. Greg is a frog.
3. Bernhard is a swan.
4. Brian is a lion.
5. Brian is green.
6. Lily is gray.
7. Bernhard is gray.
8. Greg is gray.
9. Julius is a lion.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Julius?"	green	since julius is a lion (sentence 9), and brian is also a lion (sentence 4), it can be inferred that julius and brian share the same characteristics. one of the characteristics of brian is that he is green (sentence 5). therefore, it is logical to assume that julius, being a lion like brian, is also green.	fully	Not mentioned	False	Since Julius is a lion (sentence 9), and there is no information about the color of Julius, we can infer that Julius is not gray (since Greg, a frog, is gray, and Bernhard, a swan, is gray, but Julius is a lion, which is a different species). Therefore, we can conclude that Julius's color is not mentioned in the context sentences.		"Reasoning: Since Julius is a lion (sentence 9), and there is no information about the color of Julius, we can infer that Julius is not gray (since Greg, a frog, is gray, and Bernhard, a swan, is gray, but Julius is a lion, which is a different species).
