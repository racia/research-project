Here are the context sentences:
1. Lily is a rhino.
2. Bernhard is a frog.
3. Julius is a lion.
4. Brian is a lion.
5. Brian is white.
6. Bernhard is white.
7. Lily is white.
8. Greg is a rhino.
9. Greg is white.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Julius?"	white	since julius is a lion (sentence 3), and brian is also a lion (sentence 4), we can infer that julius and brian share the same characteristics as they belong to the same species. we know that brian is white (sentence 5), so it is logical to assume that julius, being a lion like brian, is also white.	fully	Not mentioned	False	The question asks about the color of Julius, who is a lion according to sentence 3. Since the color of lions is not mentioned in the given context, we need to infer it based on the information provided. Julius is not mentioned as having a specific color, unlike Brian and Bernhard, who are both white. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact color of Julius.
