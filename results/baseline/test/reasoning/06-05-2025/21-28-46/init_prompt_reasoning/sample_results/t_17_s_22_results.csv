Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is to the right of the pink rectangle.
2. The blue square is below the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle below the yellow square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the blue square is to the right of the pink rectangle (sentence 1) and the blue square is below the yellow square (sentence 2). since the blue square is below the yellow square, and the pink rectangle is to the left of the blue square, we can logically conclude that the pink rectangle is also below the yellow square.	fully	No	False	Since the blue square is below the yellow square (sentence 2), and the blue square is to the right of the pink rectangle (sentence 1), we can infer that the pink rectangle is not directly below the yellow square. However, we need to determine if the pink rectangle is below the yellow square at all.
