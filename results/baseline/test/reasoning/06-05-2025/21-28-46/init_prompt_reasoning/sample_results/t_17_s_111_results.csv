Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is above the triangle.
2. The red square is below the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere above the triangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the red square is above the triangle (sentence 1) and the red square is below the red sphere (sentence 2). since the red square is above the triangle and below the red sphere, we can logically conclude that the red sphere is above the triangle.	fully	yes	True	Since the red square is above the triangle, and the red square is below the red sphere, we can conclude that the red sphere is above the red square. Since the red square is above the triangle, the red sphere must also be above the triangle.		"Reasoning: Since the red square is above the triangle, and the red square is below the red sphere, we can conclude that the red sphere is above the red square. Since the red square is above the triangle, the red sphere must also be above the triangle.
