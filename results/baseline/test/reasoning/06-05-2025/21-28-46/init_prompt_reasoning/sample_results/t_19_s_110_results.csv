Here are the context sentences:
1. The bathroom is south of the kitchen.
2. The bedroom is west of the bathroom.
3. The hallway is east of the garden.
4. The kitchen is south of the office.
5. The bathroom is west of the garden.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the kitchen to the garden?"	south east	"from sentence 1, we know the bathroom is south of the kitchen. from sentence 5, we know the bathroom is west of the garden. therefore, if we go south from the kitchen, we will reach the bathroom, and then if we go east from the bathroom, we will reach the garden. hence, to go from the kitchen to the garden, we need to go south and then east, which is represented as ""south east""."	fully		False	Since the kitchen is south of the office (sentence 4), and the hallway is east of the garden (sentence 3), we can infer that the kitchen is not directly adjacent to the garden. However, the bathroom is west of the garden (sentence 5), and the kitchen is south of the bathroom (sentence 1). This means that to get from the kitchen to the garden, we need to go west to the bathroom and then east to the garden.
