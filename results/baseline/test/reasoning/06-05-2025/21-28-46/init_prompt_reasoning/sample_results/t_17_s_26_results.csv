Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is to the left of the yellow square.
2. The red square is to the right of the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square to the right of the red sphere?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red square is to the left of the yellow square. from context sentence 2, we know that the red square is to the right of the red sphere. therefore, we can logically conclude that the yellow square must be to the left of the red square, and the red square is to the right of the red sphere. this means that the yellow square is to the left of the red square, and the red square is to the	fully	No	False	The question asks about the relation between the yellow square and the red sphere.
