Here are the context sentences:
1. Bernhard is a frog.
2. Greg is a rhino.
3. Greg is green.
4. Brian is a swan.
5. Lily is a lion.
6. Lily is yellow.
7. Bernhard is green.
8. Julius is a frog.
9. Brian is gray.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Julius?"	green	since julius is a frog (sentence 8), and bernhard is also a frog (sentence 1), and bernhard is green (sentence 7), it can be logically inferred that julius, being a frog like bernhard, is also green.	fully	green	True	Since Julius is a frog (sentence 8), and Bernhard, who is also a frog, is green (sentence 7), it's likely that Julius is also green, as frogs are typically green. However, there's no direct mention of Julius's color. The only information we have is that Julius is a frog, which doesn't provide a specific color.
