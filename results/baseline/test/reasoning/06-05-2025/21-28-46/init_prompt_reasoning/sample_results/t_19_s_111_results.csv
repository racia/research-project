Here are the context sentences:
1. The bedroom is east of the hallway.
2. The garden is south of the bathroom.
3. The office is north of the bathroom.
4. The garden is west of the hallway.
5. The kitchen is south of the hallway.

Now, answer the following question:
How do you go from the hallway to the bathroom?"	west north	from the context sentences, we know that the garden is west of the hallway (sentence 4) and the garden is south of the bathroom (sentence 2). this means that if we go west from the hallway, we will reach the garden. since the garden is south of the bathroom, we need to go north from the garden to reach the bathroom. therefore, to go from the hallway to the bathroom, we need to go west and then north.	fully	south	False	Since the bedroom is east of the hallway, it implies that the hallway is not east. Similarly, since the garden is west of the hallway, it implies that the hallway is not west. This leaves us with the possibility that the hallway is north or south of the bathroom. Since the office is north of the bathroom, it implies that the hallway cannot be north of the bathroom. Therefore, the hallway must be south of the bathroom.
