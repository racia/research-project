Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is below the red sphere.
2. The yellow square is below the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere above the yellow square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is below the red sphere (sentence 1), and the yellow square is below the triangle (sentence 2). therefore, we can logically conclude that the yellow square is below the triangle, and the triangle is below the red sphere. this implies that the red sphere is above the yellow square, which is the correct answer.	fully	no	False	The triangle is below the red sphere, and the yellow square is below the triangle. This implies that the yellow square is below the red sphere. Since the red sphere is above the triangle, it is not directly above the yellow square.		"Reasoning: The triangle is below the red sphere, and the yellow square is below the triangle. This implies that the yellow square is below the red sphere. Since the red sphere is above the triangle, it is not directly above the yellow square.
