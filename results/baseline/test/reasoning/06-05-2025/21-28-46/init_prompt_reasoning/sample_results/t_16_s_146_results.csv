Here are the context sentences:
1. Lily is a frog.
2. Greg is a lion.
3. Julius is a lion.
4. Brian is a frog.
5. Lily is white.
6. Brian is white.
7. Julius is green.
8. Bernhard is a frog.
9. Bernhard is white.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	green	since greg is a lion (sentence 2), and julius is also a lion (sentence 3), we can infer that greg and julius share similar characteristics as they belong to the same species. we know that julius is green (sentence 7), so it is logical to assume that greg, being a lion like julius, is also green.	fully	Not mentioned	False	The question asks about the color of Greg, who is a lion according to sentence 2. Since the color of a lion is not mentioned in the given context, we need to infer it logically. However, there is no information provided about the color of lions. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact color of Greg.		"Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Greg, who is a lion according to sentence 2.
