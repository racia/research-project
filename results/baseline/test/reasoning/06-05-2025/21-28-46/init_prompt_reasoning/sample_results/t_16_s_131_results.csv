4. Bernhard is white.
5. Brian is a lion.
6. Greg is a rhino.
7. Lily is gray.
8. Brian is white.
9. Julius is white.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	white	since greg is a rhino (from context sentence 6), and julius is also a rhino (from context sentence 1) and is white (from context sentence 9), it can be logically inferred that greg, being of the same species as julius, is also white.	fully	white	True	The question asks about the color of Greg, who is a rhino according to sentence 6.
