Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is below the red square.
2. The red square is to the left of the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere below the pink rectangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the red sphere is below the red square (sentence 1). we also know that the red square is to the left of the pink rectangle (sentence 2). since the red sphere is below the red square, and the red square is to the left of the pink rectangle, we can logically conclude that the red sphere is below the pink rectangle.	fully	unknown	False	The red sphere is below the red square, and the red square is to the left of the pink rectangle. Since the red sphere is below the red square, and the red square is to the left of the pink rectangle, we can infer that the red sphere is not directly below the pink rectangle. However, we don't have any information about the relative positions of the red sphere and the pink rectangle in the vertical direction.
