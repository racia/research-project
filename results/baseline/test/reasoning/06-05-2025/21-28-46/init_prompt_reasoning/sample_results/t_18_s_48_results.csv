1. The chest is bigger than the suitcase.
2. The container is bigger than the suitcase.
3. The chest is bigger than the suitcase.
4. The box of chocolates fits inside the chest.
5. The container is bigger than the chest.

Now, answer the following question:
Does the suitcase fit in the container?"	yes	from sentence 1, we know the chest is bigger than the suitcase. from sentence 5, we know the container is bigger than the chest. therefore, we can logically conclude that the container is also bigger than the suitcase (since the chest is bigger than the suitcase and the container is bigger than the chest). this means the suitcase can fit inside the container, so the answer is yes.	fully	yes	True	Since the container is bigger than the suitcase (sentence 2), and the chest is bigger than the suitcase (sentence 3), it is logical to conclude that the container is also bigger than the chest. This means that the container has enough space to accommodate the chest, which in turn has enough space to accommodate the box of chocolates (sentence 4). Therefore, it is possible to fit the suitcase inside the container.
