Here are the context sentences:
1. Lily is a swan.
2. Brian is a rhino.
3. Lily is white.
4. Greg is a frog.
5. Bernhard is a lion.
6. Bernhard is white.
7. Julius is a swan.
8. Greg is green.
9. Brian is white.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Julius?"	white	since julius is a swan (sentence 7), and lily is also a swan (sentence 1) and is white (sentence 3), it can be logically inferred that julius, being of the same species as lily, is also white.	fully	White	True	Since Julius is a swan (sentence 7), and swans are typically white, it is inferred that Julius is white. Additionally, Lily is also a swan (sentence 1) and is white (sentence 3), which further supports the inference.		"Reasoning: Since Julius is a swan (sentence 7), and swans are typically white, it is inferred that Julius is white. Additionally, Lily is also a swan (sentence 1) and is white (sentence 3), which further supports the inference.
