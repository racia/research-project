Here are the context sentences:
1. Bernhard is a lion.
2. Greg is a frog.
3. Greg is green.
4. Lily is a rhino.
5. Lily is gray.
6. Julius is a swan.
7. Bernhard is gray.
8. Brian is a rhino.
9. Julius is green.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Brian?"	gray	since brian is a rhino (sentence 8), and lily is also a rhino (sentence 4) and gray (sentence 5), it can be logically inferred that brian, being a rhino like lily, is also gray.	fully	Not mentioned	False	Since Brian is a rhino (from sentence 4), and Julius is also a rhino (from sentence 6), we can infer that Brian's color is not mentioned in the given context. However, we can look for any information about Brian's color. Julius is green (from sentence 9), but this does not necessarily mean Brian is also green. Since Brian's color is not mentioned, we cannot conclude a specific color.
