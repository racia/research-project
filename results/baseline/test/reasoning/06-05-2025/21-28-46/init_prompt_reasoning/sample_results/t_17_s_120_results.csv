Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is to the left of the yellow square.
2. The pink rectangle is above the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the left of the yellow square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the yellow square (sentence 1) and the pink rectangle is above the triangle (sentence 2). since the pink rectangle is above the triangle, it means the triangle is below the pink rectangle. as the pink rectangle is to the left of the yellow square, the triangle, being below the pink rectangle, must also be to the left of the yellow square. therefore, the answer is yes, the	fully	No	False	The triangle is above the pink rectangle (from sentence 2), and the pink rectangle is to the left of the yellow square (from sentence 1). Since the triangle is above the pink rectangle, it cannot be to the left of the yellow square, as the pink rectangle is already occupying that position.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle below the yellow square?"	yes	we previously established that the triangle is to the left of the yellow square (previous question). we also know that the pink rectangle is above the triangle (sentence 2) and the pink rectangle is to the left of the yellow square (sentence 1). since the triangle is to the left of the yellow square and the pink rectangle is above the triangle, it can be logically inferred that the triangle is below the yellow square. therefore, the answer is yes.	none	Unknown	False	Since there is no information provided that suggests the triangle is above or below the yellow square, we cannot conclude anything about the relative positions of the triangle and the yellow square.
