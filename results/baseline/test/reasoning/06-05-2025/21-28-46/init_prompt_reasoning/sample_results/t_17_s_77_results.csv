Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is to the left of the triangle.
2. The red square is above the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square to the left of the triangle?"	yes	from the first context sentence, we know that the red square is to the left of the triangle. from the second context sentence, we know that the red square is above the yellow square. since the red square is above the yellow square, the yellow square must be below the red square. therefore, if the red square is to the left of the triangle, the yellow square must also be to the left of the triangle, as it is below the red square.	fully	No	False	The question asks about the relation between the yellow square and the triangle. Since the red square is to the left of the triangle, we need to consider the position of the yellow square relative to the red square. The red square is above the yellow square, but this information does not provide any direct relation between the yellow square and the triangle.
