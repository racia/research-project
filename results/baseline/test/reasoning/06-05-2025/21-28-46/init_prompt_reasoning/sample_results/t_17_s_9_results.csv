Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is above the yellow square.
2. The red sphere is to the right of the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square to the left of the red square?"	no	from context sentence 1, we know that the red sphere is above the yellow square, which implies that they are in the same vertical column. from context sentence 2, we know that the red sphere is to the right of the red square. since the red sphere is above the yellow square and to the right of the red square, it can be inferred that the yellow square is not to the left of the red square. if it were, the red sphere would not be above	fully		False	The question asks about the relation between the yellow square and the red square.
