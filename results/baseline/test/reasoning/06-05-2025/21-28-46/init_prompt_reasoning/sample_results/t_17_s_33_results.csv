Here are the context sentences:
1. The yellow square is to the right of the blue square.
2. The yellow square is below the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square to the right of the triangle?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is to the right of the blue square (sentence 1) and the yellow square is below the triangle (sentence 2). since the yellow square is below the triangle, it means the triangle is above the yellow square. now, if the blue square is to the right of the triangle, it would mean the blue square is above the yellow square, which contradicts sentence 1. therefore, the blue square cannot be to	fully	No	True	Since the yellow square is to the right of the blue square, it implies that the blue square is to the left of the yellow square. Additionally, the yellow square is below the triangle, which means the blue square is not directly related to the triangle in terms of its position. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the blue square is to the right of the triangle.
