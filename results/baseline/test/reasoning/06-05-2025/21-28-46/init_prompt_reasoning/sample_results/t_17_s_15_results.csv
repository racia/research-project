2. The pink rectangle is to the right of the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the right of the pink rectangle?"	no	"from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is to the left of the red sphere (sentence 1) and the pink rectangle is to the right of the red sphere (sentence 2). since the triangle is to the left of the red sphere and the pink rectangle is to the right of the red sphere, it can be logically inferred that the triangle is to the left of the pink rectangle. therefore, the answer is ""no"", the triangle is not to the right of"	fully	no	True	The triangle is to the left of the red sphere, and the pink rectangle is to the right of the red sphere.
