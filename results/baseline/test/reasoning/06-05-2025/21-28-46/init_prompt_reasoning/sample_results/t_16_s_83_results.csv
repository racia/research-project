Here are the context sentences:
1. Bernhard is a frog.
2. Lily is a frog.
3. Bernhard is white.
4. Brian is a frog.
5. Lily is white.
6. Greg is a rhino.
7. Brian is white.
8. Julius is a rhino.
9. Julius is gray.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	gray	since greg is a rhino (sentence 6), and julius is also a rhino (sentence 8), we can infer that greg and julius share similar characteristics as they belong to the same species. additionally, sentence 9 states that julius is gray. therefore, it is logical to assume that greg, being a rhino like julius, also shares the same color, which is gray.	fully		False	The question asks about the color of Greg, who is a rhino according to sentence 6. Since there is no mention of Greg's color in the given sentences, we need to infer it logically. We know that Bernhard is white (sentence 3), but Bernhard is a frog, not a rhino. Similarly, Brian is white (sentence 7), but Brian is a frog, not a rhino. Julius is gray (sentence 9), but Julius		Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Greg, who is a rhino according to sentence 6. Since there is no mention of Greg's color in the given sentences, we need to infer it logically. We know that Bernhard is white (sentence 3), but Bernhard is a frog, not a rhino. Similarly, Brian is white (sentence 7), but Brian is a frog, not a rhino. Julius is gray (sentence 9), but Julius	0.1313	0.0303	False	False	False	True	0
