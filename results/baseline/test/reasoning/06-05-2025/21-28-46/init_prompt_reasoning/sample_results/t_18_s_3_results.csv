3. The box of chocolates fits inside the container.
4. The container fits inside the chest.
5. The chocolate fits inside the suitcase.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the chest bigger than the suitcase?"	yes	from context sentence 2, we know the suitcase fits inside the container. from context sentence 4, we know the container fits inside the chest. therefore, the chest must be bigger than the container. since the suitcase fits inside the container, the chest must also be bigger than the suitcase.	fully	yes	True	The container fits inside the chest (sentence 4), and the suitcase fits inside the container (sentence 2). This means the suitcase is smaller than the container.

Therefore, the chest is bigger than the suitcase because it fits the container, which is bigger than the suitcase.
