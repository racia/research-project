2. The yellow square is above the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square below the yellow square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is above the blue square (sentence 1), and the yellow square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 2). this creates a vertical relationship between the objects, where the yellow square is at the top, followed by the pink rectangle, and then the blue square at the bottom. therefore, the blue square is indeed below the yellow square.	fully	no	False	From sentence 1, we know the pink rectangle is above the blue square. From sentence 2, we know the yellow square is above the pink rectangle. Since the yellow square is above the pink rectangle, and the pink rectangle is above the blue square, we can conclude that the yellow square is above the blue square. This means the blue square cannot be below the yellow square.		"Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the pink rectangle is above the blue square.
