Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is above the triangle.
2. The triangle is to the right of the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the left of the blue square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is above the triangle (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the right of the blue square (sentence 2). since the triangle is to the right of the blue square, and the pink rectangle is above the triangle, it means the pink rectangle is also to the right of the blue square, or at least above and to the right of it. therefore, the pink rectangle cannot be to the left of the blue square	fully	No	True	The pink rectangle is above the triangle, and the triangle is to the right of the blue square. This means that the pink rectangle is not directly related to the blue square in terms of left or right. However, since the pink rectangle is above the triangle, it is possible that the pink rectangle is above the blue square as well. But we cannot conclude that the pink rectangle is to the left of the blue square without additional information.
