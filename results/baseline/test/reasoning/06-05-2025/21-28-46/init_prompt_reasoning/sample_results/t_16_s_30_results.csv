Here are the context sentences:
1. Greg is a lion.
2. Brian is a swan.
3. Bernhard is a swan.
4. Bernhard is gray.
5. Greg is white.
6. Lily is a lion.
7. Julius is a frog.
8. Julius is white.
9. Lily is yellow.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Brian?"	gray	since bernhard is a swan (sentence 3) and bernhard is gray (sentence 4), we can infer that at least one swan is gray. brian is also a swan (sentence 2), and there is no information provided about brian's color. therefore, it is logical to assume that brian, being a swan, shares the same color as another swan, bernhard, which is gray.	fully	white	False	The question asks about the color of Brian, who is described as a swan in sentence 2. Since swans are typically white, and there is no mention of Brian having a different color, it can be inferred that Brian is likely white.		"Reasoning: The question asks about the color of Brian, who is described as a swan in sentence 2. Since swans are typically white, and there is no mention of Brian having a different color, it can be inferred that Brian is likely white.
