5. The bedroom is north of the garden.

Now, answer the following question:

However, the garden is west of the kitchen (sentence 1), and the kitchen is north of the office (sentence 2). Since the bedroom is north of the garden (sentence 5), we can infer that the garden is east of the bedroom. Combining this information	0.1313	0.0202	False	False	False	True	0
