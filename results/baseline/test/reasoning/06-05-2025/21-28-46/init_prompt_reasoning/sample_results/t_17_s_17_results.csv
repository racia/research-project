Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is above the red square.
2. The red square is above the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle above the pink rectangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is above the red square (sentence 1), and the red square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 2). therefore, we can logically conclude that the triangle is above the pink rectangle, as it is above the red square, which in turn is above the pink rectangle. this forms a vertical hierarchy of objects, with the triangle at the top, followed by the red square, and then the pink rectangle at the bottom.	fully	yes	True	The triangle is above the red square, and the red square is above the pink rectangle. This implies that the triangle is above the pink rectangle.		"Reasoning: The triangle is above the red square, and the red square is above the pink rectangle. This implies that the triangle is above the pink rectangle.
