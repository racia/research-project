Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is to the right of the red sphere.
2. The blue square is to the left of the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere above the red square?"	no	"the context sentences only provide information about the relative positions of the blue square and the red sphere/square in the horizontal direction (left and right). there is no information provided about the vertical direction (above or below). therefore, we cannot conclude that the red sphere is above the red square, and the answer is ""no""."	fully	Not mentioned	False	The context sentences only provide information about the relative positions of the blue square and the red sphere/square, but do not mention the position of the red sphere relative to the red square. Since the red sphere is to the right of the blue square, and the blue square is to the left of the red square, we cannot infer the position of the red sphere relative to the red square.
