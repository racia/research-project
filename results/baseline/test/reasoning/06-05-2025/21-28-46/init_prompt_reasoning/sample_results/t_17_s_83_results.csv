Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is above the red sphere.
2. The triangle is to the right of the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the left of the triangle?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red square is above the red sphere. from context sentence 2, we know that the triangle is to the right of the red sphere. since the red sphere is below the red square (from sentence 1) and to the left of the triangle (from sentence 2), we can logically conclude that the red square is above and to the left of the triangle, which means the red square is to the left of the triangle.	fully	No	False	The red square is above the red sphere, and the triangle is to the right of the red sphere. Since the red square is above the red sphere, it is not directly related to the triangle. The triangle is to the right of the red sphere, but there is no information about the position of the red square relative to the triangle.
