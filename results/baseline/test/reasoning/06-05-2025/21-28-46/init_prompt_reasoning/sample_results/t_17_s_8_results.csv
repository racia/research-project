Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is below the red square.
2. The triangle is to the left of the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle below the triangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is below the red square (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the left of the red square (sentence 2). since the pink rectangle is below the red square, and the triangle is to the left of the red square, it can be logically inferred that the pink rectangle is also below the triangle. therefore, the answer is yes, the pink rectangle is below the triangle.	fully	Not mentioned	False	The question asks about the relationship between the pink rectangle and the triangle. Since the triangle is to the left of the red square (from sentence 2), we can infer that the triangle is not directly related to the pink rectangle's position (which is below the red square, from sentence 1). Therefore, we cannot determine the pink rectangle's position relative to the triangle.		"Reasoning: The question asks about the relationship between the pink rectangle and the triangle.
