Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is to the left of the yellow square.
2. The triangle is below the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere below the yellow square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is to the left of the yellow square (sentence 1) and the triangle is below the red sphere (sentence 2). since the triangle is below the red sphere, the red sphere must be above the triangle. and since the triangle is to the left of the yellow square, the yellow square must be to the right of the triangle. therefore, the red sphere, which is above the triangle, cannot be below the yellow square	fully	yes	False	The triangle is below the red sphere, which means the red sphere is above the triangle. Since the triangle is to the left of the yellow square, the red sphere is above the yellow square, making the red sphere below the yellow square.		"Reasoning: The triangle is below the red sphere, which means the red sphere is above the triangle. Since the triangle is to the left of the yellow square, the red sphere is above the yellow square, making the red sphere below the yellow square.
