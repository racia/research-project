Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is above the red sphere.
2. The blue square is to the left of the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere to the left of the blue square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is above the red sphere (sentence 1), and the blue square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 2). since the triangle is above the red sphere, the red sphere must be below the triangle. if the blue square is to the left of the triangle, and the triangle is above the red sphere, then the blue square must be to the left of the triangle and above the red sphere. therefore, the red	fully	No	True	The triangle is above the red sphere, and the blue square is to the left of the triangle. This implies that the blue square is not directly above or below the red sphere. The red sphere's position is only mentioned as being above the triangle, not in relation to the blue square.
