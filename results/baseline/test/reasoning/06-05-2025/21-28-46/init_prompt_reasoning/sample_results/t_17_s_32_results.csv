Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is below the triangle.
2. The blue square is above the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square to the right of the triangle?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the blue square is below the triangle (sentence 1) and above the yellow square (sentence 2). this implies that the yellow square is below the blue square. since the blue square is below the triangle, the yellow square must also be below the triangle. there is no information provided about the left-right orientation of the shapes, but we can infer that the yellow square is not to the right of the triangle because it is below the triangle	fully	Not mentioned	False	Since the blue square is above the yellow square, it means the yellow square is below the blue square. Also, the blue square is below the triangle, which implies that the yellow square is below the triangle as well. However, the question asks if the yellow square is to the right of the triangle, not below. We need to consider the relative positions of the yellow square and the triangle.
