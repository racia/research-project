Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
red
square
.
Since
the
blue
square
is
above
the
red
sphere
,
it
implies
that
the
red
sphere
is
not
above
the
red
square
.
The
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
which
does
not
provide
any
information
about
the
position
of
the
red
sphere
relative
to
the
red
square
.

No
