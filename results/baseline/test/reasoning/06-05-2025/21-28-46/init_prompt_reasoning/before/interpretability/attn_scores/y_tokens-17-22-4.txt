Reason
ing
:
Since
the
blue
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
blue
square
is
below
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

2
),
we
can
infer
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
necessarily
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
.
The
blue
square
's
position
relative
to
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
yellow
square
suggests
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
.
