Reason
ing
:
From
the
given
context
sentences
,
we
can
infer
that
the
garden
is
south
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

3
)
and
the
bathroom
is
west
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

5
).
Since
the
bathroom
is
also
south
of
the
hallway
(
sentence

1
),
we
can
conclude
that
the
bathroom
is
south
of
the
garden
.
To
go
from
the
garden
to
the
bathroom
,
we
need
to
move
north
(
t
oward
the
bedroom
)
and
then
west
.
Answer
