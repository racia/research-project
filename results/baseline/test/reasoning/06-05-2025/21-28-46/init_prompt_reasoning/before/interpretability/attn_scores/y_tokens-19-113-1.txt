Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bathroom
is
west
of
the
bedroom
,
and
the
office
is
south
of
the
bedroom
,
we
can
infer
that
the
office
is
also
south
of
the
bathroom
.
Additionally
,
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
office
,
which
means
that
the
office
is
not
directly
east
of
the
bathroom
.
Therefore
,
to
go
from
the
bathroom
to
the
office
,
we
need
to
move
south
.
Answer
:
south
