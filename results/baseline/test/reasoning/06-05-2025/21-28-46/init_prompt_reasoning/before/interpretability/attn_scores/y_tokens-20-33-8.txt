Reason
ing
:
Since
Jason
took
the
football
,
it
is
likely
that
Jason
got
the
football
because
Jason
is
bored
(
as
mentioned
in
context
sentence

1
).
The
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
other
information
about
Jason
's
motivations
,
so
I
will
make
an
inference
based
on
the
assumption
that
Jason
's
boredom
led
to
the
decision
to
get
the
football
.
Answer
:
bored
