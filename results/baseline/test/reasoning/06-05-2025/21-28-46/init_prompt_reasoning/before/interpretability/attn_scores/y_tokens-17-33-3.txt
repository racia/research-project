Reason
ing
:
Since
the
triangle
is
above
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
it
implies
that
the
triangle
is
above
the
blue
square
.
However
,
there
is
no
information
provided
about
the
position
of
the
blue
square
relative
to
the
triangle
.
The
triangle
could
be
above
,
below
,
or
to
the
left
or
right
of
the
blue
square
,
but
we
cannot
conclude
that
the
blue
square
is
specifically
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
.
