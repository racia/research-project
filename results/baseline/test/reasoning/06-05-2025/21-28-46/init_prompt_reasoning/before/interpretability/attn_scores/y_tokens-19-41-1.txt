Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bathroom
is
east
of
the
garden
(
sentence

5
),
and
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
bathroom
(
sentence

4
),
we
can
infer
that
the
bathroom
is
not
directly
adjacent
to
the
kitchen
.
However
,
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
kitchen
(
sentence

3
),
which
means
that
we
can
go
from
the
bathroom
to
the
kitchen
by
going
north
to
the
hallway
and
then
east
to
the
kitchen
.
