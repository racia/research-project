Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Greg
,
who
is
a
lion
according
to
sentence

9
.
Since
Julius
,
who
is
also
a
lion
,
is
gray
(
not
mentioned
in
the
context
),
we
cannot
infer
the
color
of
Greg
from
Julius
.
However
,
Bern
hard
,
who
is
also
a
lion
,
is
yellow
(
sentence

8
).
Since
there
is
no
information
contradict
ing
this
,
we
can
assume
that
Greg
,
being
a
lion
,
is
also
yellow
.
Answer
:
yellow
