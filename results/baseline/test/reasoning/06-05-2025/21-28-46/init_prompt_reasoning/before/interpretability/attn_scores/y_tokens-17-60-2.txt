Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
blue
square
(
sentence

2
).
We
also
know
that
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
(
sentence

1
).
Since
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
blue
square
,
we
can
infer
that
the
blue
square
is
not
necessarily
above
the
red
square
.
The
information
provided
does
not
give
us
a
direct
relation
between
the
blue
square
and
the
red
square
.
Answer
:
No
