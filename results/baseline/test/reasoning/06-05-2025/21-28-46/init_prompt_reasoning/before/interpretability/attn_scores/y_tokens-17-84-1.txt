Reason
ing
:
The
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

2
),
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
(
from
sentence

1
).
This
means
that
the
triangle
is
not
directly
above
or
below
the
blue
square
.
However
,
since
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
the
triangle
must
be
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
.
