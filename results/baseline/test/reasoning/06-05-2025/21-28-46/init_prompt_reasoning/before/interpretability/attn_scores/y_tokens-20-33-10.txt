Reason
ing
:
Since
Sum
it
went
to
the
kitchen
,
it
is
likely
that
Sum
it
went
to
the
kitchen
because
Sum
it
is
thirsty
(
as
mentioned
in
context
sentence

17
).
The
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
other
information
about
Sum
it
's
motivations
,
so
I
will
make
an
inference
based
on
the
assumption
that
Sum
it
's
thirst
led
to
the
decision
to
go
to
the
kitchen
.
Answer
:
thirsty
