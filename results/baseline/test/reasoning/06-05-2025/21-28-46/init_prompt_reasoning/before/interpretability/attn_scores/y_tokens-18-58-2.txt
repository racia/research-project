Reason
ing
:
The
chest
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
,
and
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
suitcase
.
Since
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
,
it
implies
that
the
chest
is
larger
than
the
chocolate
.
The
container
fits
inside
the
chest
,
which
means
the
container
is
smaller
than
the
chest
.
Since
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
suitcase
,
it
implies
that
the
chest
(
which
is
bigger
than
the
container
)
is
also
bigger
than
the
suitcase
.
Therefore
,
the
chest
cannot
fit
inside
the
suitcase
.
