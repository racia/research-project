Reason
ing
:
Since
the
garden
is
west
of
the
bathroom
(
sentence

3
),
and
the
bedroom
is
west
of
the
kitchen
(
sentence

1
),
we
can
infer
that
the
bedroom
is
also
west
of
the
garden
.
Additionally
,
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

2
),
which
means
that
to
go
from
the
garden
to
the
bedroom
,
we
need
to
go
west
first
and
then
north
.
