Reason
ing
:
The
triangle
is
below
the
red
sphere
,
which
means
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
triangle
.
Since
the
triangle
is

the

of
the
yellow

,
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
triangle
,
which
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
.
This
means
the
red
sphere
is
not
directly
above
the
yellow
square
,
but
above
something
that
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
.
