Reason
ing
:
Since
the
office
is
north
of
the
garden
(
sentence

2
),
and
the
kitchen
is
north
of
the
hallway
(
sentence

4
),
we
can
conclude
that
the
office
is
north
of
the
hallway
.
Additionally
,
the
kitchen
is
east
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

3
),
and
the
kitchen
is
north
of
the
hallway
(
sentence

4
),
which
means
the
kitchen
is
east
of
the
hallway
.
Therefore
,
to
go
from
the
office
to
the
kitchen
,
we
need
to
move
east
from
the
hallway
.
