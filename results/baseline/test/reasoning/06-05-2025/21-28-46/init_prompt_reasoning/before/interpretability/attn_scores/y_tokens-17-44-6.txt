Reason
ing
:
Since
the
red
square
is
below
the
red
sphere
,
it
implies
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
red
square
.
Additionally
,
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
However
,
there
is
no
direct
information
about
the
position
of
the
triangle
relative
to
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
red
square
,
it
is
possible
that
the
red
sphere
is
also
above
the
triangle
.
