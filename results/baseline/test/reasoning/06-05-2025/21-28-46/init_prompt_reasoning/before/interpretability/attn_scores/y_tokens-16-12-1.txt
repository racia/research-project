Reason
ing
:
Since
Bern
hard
is
a
sw
an
,
and
sw
ans
are
typically
white
,
it
is
likely
that
Bern
hard
is
white
.
However
,
there
is
no
direct
mention
of
Bern
hard
's
color
in
the
context
sentences
.
We
can
infer
Bern
hard
's
color
by
considering
the
colors
of
other
sw
ans
.
Since
Brian
is
also
a
sw
an
and
is
yellow
,
it
is
possible
that
Bern
hard
is
also
yellow
.
