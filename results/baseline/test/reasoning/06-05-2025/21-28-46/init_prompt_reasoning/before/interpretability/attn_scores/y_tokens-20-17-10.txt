Reason
ing
:
Since
Sum
it
journey
ed
to
the
kitchen
,
it
is
likely
that
Sum
it
went
to
the
kitchen
because
of
the
previous
context
sentence
stating
that
Sum
it
is
tired
.
However
,
there
is
no
previous
context
sentence
mentioning
Sum
it
's
tired
ness
.
Therefore
,
I
will
assume
that
the
information
is
not
specified
directly
