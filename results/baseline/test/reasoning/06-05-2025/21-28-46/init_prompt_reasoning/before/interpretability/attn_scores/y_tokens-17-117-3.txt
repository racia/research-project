The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
pink
rectangle
and
the

answer
this
,
we
need

the
positions
of
these

.
From
sentence

1
,
we
know
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
right

From

2
,
we
know
the

sphere
is
below
the
yellow

Since
the
pink

not
mentioned
in
relation
to
the
red
sphere
's
vertical
position
,
we
cannot
infer
whether
the
