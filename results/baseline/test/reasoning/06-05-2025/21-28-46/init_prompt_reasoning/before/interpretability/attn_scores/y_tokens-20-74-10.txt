Reason
ing
:
Since
Antoine
moved
to
the
bedroom
,
it
is
likely
that
he
went
there
for
a
reason
.
The
previous
context
sentence
mentioned
that
Antoine
was
tired
,
and
going
to
the
bedroom
might
be
a
way
to
rest
or
sleep
.
Additionally
,
the
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
other
information
about
Antoine
's
motivations
,
so
I
will
rely
on
the
assumption
that
his
tired
ness
was
the
reason
for
his
movement
.

tired
