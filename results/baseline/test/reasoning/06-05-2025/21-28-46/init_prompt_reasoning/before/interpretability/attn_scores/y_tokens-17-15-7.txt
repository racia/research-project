ing
:
The
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red

,
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right

the
red
sphere

This
means
that
the
triangle
is
on
one

the
red

is
on
the
other
side

Since

triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red

,
it
is
also
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
(
because
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
).
