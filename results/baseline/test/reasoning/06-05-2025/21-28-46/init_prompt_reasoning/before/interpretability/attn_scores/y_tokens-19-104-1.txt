Reason
ing
:
Since
the
kitchen
is
west
of
the
bathroom
,
and
the
bathroom
is
south
of
the
garden
,
we
can
infer
that
the
kitchen
is
not
directly
adjacent
to
the
garden
.
However
,
we
can
move
east
from
the
kitchen
to
reach
the
bathroom
,
and
then
south
from
the
bathroom
to
reach
the
garden
.
Answer
