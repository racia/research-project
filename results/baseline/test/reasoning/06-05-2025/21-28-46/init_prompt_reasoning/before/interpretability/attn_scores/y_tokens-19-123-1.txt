Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bathroom
is
east
of
the
hallway
,
and
the
office
is
east
of
the
kitchen
,
and
the
kitchen
is
east
of
the
bathroom
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
bathroom
and
the
office
are
in
the
same
direction
(
east
).
Additionally
,
the
office
is
north
of
the
garden
,
and
the
bathroom
is
east
of
the
hallway
,
which
implies
that
the
bathroom
is
not
directly
north
of
the
office
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
the
bathroom
is
east
of
the
office
.
