Reason
ing
:
The
blue
square
is
above
the
red
square
,
but
there
is
no
information
about
the
relationship
between
the
yellow
square
and
the
blue
square
.
Since
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
it
doesn
't
necessarily
mean
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
blue
square
.
We
can
't
conclude
the
position
of
the
yellow
square
relative
to
the
red
square
.
