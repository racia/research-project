Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
yellow
square
and
the
triangle
.
Since
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
we
need
to
consider
the
position
of
the
yellow
square
relative
to
the
red
square
.
The
red
square
is
above
the
yellow
square
,
but
this
information
does
not
provide
any
direct
relation
between
the
yellow
square
and
the
triangle
.
Answer
:
No
