Reason
ing
:
The
blue
square
is
below
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
.
This
means
that
the
blue
square
is
not
directly
above
or
below
the
red
sphere
.
However
,
since
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
the
blue
square
must
be
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
