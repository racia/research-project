Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
container
fits
inside
the
suitcase
(
sentence

2
),
and
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
suitcase
(
sentence

1
).
However
,
we
don
't
have
any
information
about
the
size
of
the
chest
compared
to
the
container
.
We
only
know
that
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
box
(
sentence

3
),
and
the
box
fits
inside
the
chest
(
sentence

4
).
Since
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
box
,
and
the
box
fits
inside
the
chest
,
it
's
possible
that
