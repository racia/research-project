Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
position
of
the
blue
square
relative
to
the
red
square
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
blue
square
is
not
above
the
red
square
,
as
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
red
square
and
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
.
Since
the
blue
square
is
not
above
the
red
square
,
it
is
possible
that
it
is
below
the
red
square
,
but
we
cannot
conclude
this
with
certainty
.
