Reason
ing
:
The
blue
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
,
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
red
sphere
.
To
determine
if
the
blue
square
is
above
the
red
sphere
,
we
need
to
consider
the
relative
positions
of
these
objects
.
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
red
sphere
,
and
the
blue
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
blue
square
is
also
above
the
red
sphere
.
