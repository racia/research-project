Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
that
the
blue
square
is
below

Since
the
triangle
is
above
the
blue
square
,
it
implies
that
the
blue
square
is
not
above
the
red
sphere
.
The
blue
square
is
below
the
red

,
and
the
triangle
is
above
the
blue
square
,
which
means
the
blue
square
is
not
above
the
red
sphere
.
