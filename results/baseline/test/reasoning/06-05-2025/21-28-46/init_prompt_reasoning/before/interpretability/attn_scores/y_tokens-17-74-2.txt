Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
yellow
square
is
above
the
triangle
.
Since
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
,
it
is
not
directly
above
or
below
the
triangle
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
triangle
is
below
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
.
Therefore
,
the
triangle
is
likely
below
the
red
sphere
.
