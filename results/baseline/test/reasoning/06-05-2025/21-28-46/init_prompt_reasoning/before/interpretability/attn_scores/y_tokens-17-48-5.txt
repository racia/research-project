Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
that
the
blue
square
is
below
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
triangle
is
above
the
blue
square
,
it
implies
that
the
blue
square
is
not
above
the
red
sphere
.
The
triangle
is
above
the
blue
square
,
but
the
blue
square
is
below
the
red
sphere
,
which
means
the
red
sphere
is
not
above
the
blue
square
.
