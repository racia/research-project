Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
red
square
,
and
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
This
implies
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
yellow
square
.
Since
the
red
square
is
below
the
yellow
square
,
it
's
possible
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
red
square
.
However
,
we
can
't
conclude
this
directly
from
the
given
information
.
