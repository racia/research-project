Reason
ing
:
Since
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
garden
,
and
the
office
is
east
of
the
garden
,
we
can
infer
that
the
office
is
east
of
the
hallway
as
well
.
This
is
because
the
office
is
east
of
the
garden
,
and
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
garden
,
which
means
the
hallway
is
also
east
of
the
garden
.
Therefore
,
to
go
from
the
hallway
to
the
office
,
we
need
to
move
east
.
