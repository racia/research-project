The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
yellow
square
and
the
red
square
.
We
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

1
),
but
this
information
doesn
't
provide
any
direct
relation
between
the
yellow
square
and
the
red
square
.
We
also
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
(
sentence

2
),
which
implies
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
However
,
this
information
doesn
't
directly
relate
to
the
yellow
