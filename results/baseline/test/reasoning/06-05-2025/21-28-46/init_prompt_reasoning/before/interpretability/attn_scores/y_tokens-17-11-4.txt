Reason
ing
:
We
already
established
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
(
from
previous
question
).
Since
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
(
from
sentence

1
),
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
blue
square
(
from
sentence

2
),
it
implies
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
.
