Reason
ing
:
Since
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
bathroom
(
sentence

2
),
and
the
bathroom
is
north
of
the
kitchen
(
sentence

5
),
we
can
infer
that
the
hallway
is
not
directly
adjacent
to
the
kitchen
.
However
,
the
hallway
is
also
north
of
the
office
(
sentence

3
),
and
the
kitchen
is
south
of
the
garden
(
sentence

1
).
This
suggests
that
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
kitchen
,
but
not
directly
adjacent
to
it
.
