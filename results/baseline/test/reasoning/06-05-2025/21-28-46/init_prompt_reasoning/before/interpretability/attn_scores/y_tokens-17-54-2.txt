Reason
ing
:
The
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
but
there
is
no
direct
information
about
the
blue
square
's
position
relative
to
the
yellow
square
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
blue
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
,
and
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
This
implies
that
the
yellow
square
is
not
necessarily
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
as
the
blue
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
.
