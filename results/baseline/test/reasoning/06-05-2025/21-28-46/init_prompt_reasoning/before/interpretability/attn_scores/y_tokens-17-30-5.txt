Reason
ing
:
The
blue
square
is
above
the
red
square
,
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
blue
square
is
above
the
red
square
,
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
blue
square
is
above
the
red
square
,
but
we
don
't
have
any
information
about
the
relative
position
of
the
blue
square
and
the
red
sphere
.
Therefore
,
we
can
't
determine
if
the
blue
square
is
above
the
red
sphere
.
