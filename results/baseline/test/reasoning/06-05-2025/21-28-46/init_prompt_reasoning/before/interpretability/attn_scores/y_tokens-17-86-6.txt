:
The
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
which
means
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
.
Since
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
red
square
,
we
can
infer
that
the
red
square
is
above
the
yellow
square
.

this
does
not
provide
any
information
about
the
position
of
the
red
square
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
