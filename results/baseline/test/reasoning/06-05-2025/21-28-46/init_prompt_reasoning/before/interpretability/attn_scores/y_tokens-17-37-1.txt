Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
blue
square
's
position
relative
to
the
triangle
.
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
triangle
(
from
sentence

2
),
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
(
from
sentence

1
),
we
can
infer
that
the
blue
square
is
not
necessarily
below
the
triangle
.
The
blue
square
's
position
is
only
known
to
be
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
which
is
below
the
triangle
.
