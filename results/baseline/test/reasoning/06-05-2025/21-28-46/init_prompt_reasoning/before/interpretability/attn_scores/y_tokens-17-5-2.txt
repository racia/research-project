Reason
ing
:
Since
the
red
square
is
below
the
triangle
(
from
previous
context
),
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
we
cannot
directly
infer
the
position
of
the
pink
rectangle
relative
to
the
triangle
.
However
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
above
the
triangle
,
as
it
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
which
is
below
the
triangle
.
