Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
that
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

2
),
and
the
blue
square
is
above
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

1
).
This
means
that
the
blue
square
is
not
directly
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
,
since
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
and
the
blue
square
is
above
the
red
square
.
