Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
mention
the
chocolate
as
a
container
that

Instead
,
the
chocolate
is
mentioned
as
something
that
fits
inside
the
chest
(
sentence

2
)
and
the
box
of
chocolates
(
sentence

5
).
The
container
is
bigger
than
the
box
(
sentence

6
),
and
the
box
fits
inside
the
chest
(
sentence

4
).
This
implies
that
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
chest
,
and
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
box
.
Therefore
,
it
