ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
triangle
.
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
red
sphere
,
it
implies
that
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
pink
rectangle
.
Additionally
,
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
which
means
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
Comb
ining
these
two
pieces
of
information
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
pink
rectangle
,
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
