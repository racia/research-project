Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Lily
,
who
is
a
frog
.
Since
Lily
is
a
frog
,
we
can
infer
that
she
is
not
mentioned
to
have
a
specific
color
in
the
given
context
sentences
.
However
,
we
can
look
for
any
clues
about
the
colors
of
other
frogs
,
like
Bern
hard
,
Julius
,
and
Brian
.
All
three
frogs
are
gray
,
which
might
suggest
that
Lily
,
being
a
frog
,
is
also
gray
.
But
we
cannot
conclude
that
for
certain
without
further
information
.
