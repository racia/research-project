Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
if
the
box
fits
inside
the
chocolate
.
However
,
the
context
sentences
do
not
mention
the
box
fitting
inside
the
chocolate
.
In
fact
,
sentence

3
states
that
the
box
of
chocolates
fits
inside
the
box
,
not
the
chocolate
.
This
implies
that

box
is
larger
than
the
chocolate
.
Therefore
,
it
is
not
possible
for
the
box
to
fit
inside
the
chocolate
.
