ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Lily
,
who
is
a
rh
ino
according
to
sentence

8
.
Since
Brian
is
also
a
rh
ino
(
sentence

3
),
we
can
infer
that
Lily
's
color
is
not
mentioned
in
the
given
context
.
However
,
we
can
look
for
any
information
about
Lily
's
color
.
Julius
is
yellow
(
sentence

2
),
but
Julius
is
a
lion
(
sentence

1
),
and
Lily
is
a
rh
ino
,
not
a
lion
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
infer
Lily
