Reason
ing
:
The
question
is
asking
if
the
box
(
mentioned
in
sentences

1
and

2
)
fits
inside
the
chocolate
.
However
,
the
chocolate
is
a
small
object
that
fits
inside
the
box
of
chocolates
(
sentence

4
),
and
the
box
of
chocolates
fits
inside
the
box
(
sentence

1
).
This
means
the
box
is
much
larger
than
the
chocolate
,
so
it
's
unlikely
that
the
box
would
fit
inside
the
chocolate
.
