Reason
ing
:
The
triangle
's
position
is
not
specified
in
relation
to
the
blue
square
.
However
,
we
know
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
blue
square
,
and
it
is
also
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
.
This
information
allows
us
to
infer
that
the
triangle
is
not
above
the
blue
square
,
as
the
red
sphere
is
.
Since
the
triangle
is
not
above
the
blue
square
,
it
is
possible
that
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
.
