Reason
ing
:
Since
Sum
it
journey
ed
to
the
kitchen
,
it
is
likely
that
he
went
there
for
a
reason
.
The
previous
context
sentence
mentioned
that
Sum
it
was
thirsty
,
and
going
to
the
kitchen
might
be
a
way
to
qu
ench
his
thirst
.
Additionally
,
the
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
other
information
about
Sum
it
's
motivations
,
so
I
will
rely
on
the
assumption
that
his
thirst
was
the
reason
for
his
movement
.
Answer

thirsty
