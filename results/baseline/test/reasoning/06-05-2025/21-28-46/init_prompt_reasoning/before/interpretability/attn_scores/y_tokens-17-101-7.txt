Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
that
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
and
the
blue
square
is
above
the
red
square
.
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
it
is
also
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
(
which
is
above
the
blue
square
).
This
means
that
the
red
square
cannot
be
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
.
