:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Brian
,
who

a
frog
according
to
sentence

8
.
Since
frogs
are
not
mentioned
as
having
a
specific
color
in
the
given
context
,
we
can
infer
that
Brian
's
color
is
not
mentioned
.
However
,
we
can
look
for
any
clues
about
the
color
of
frogs
in
general

Sentence

9
mentions
that
Greg
,
who
is
also
a
frog
,
is
gray
.
This
might
suggest
that
frogs
can
be
gray
,
but
it
's
not
a
direct
statement
about
Brian
