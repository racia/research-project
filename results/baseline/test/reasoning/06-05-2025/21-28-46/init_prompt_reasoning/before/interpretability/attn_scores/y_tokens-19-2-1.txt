Reason
ing
:
Since
the
hallway
is
west
of
the
bathroom
,
and
the
bedroom
is
north
of
the
bedroom
,
we
can
infer
that
the
bedroom
is
not
directly
adjacent
to
the
hallway
.
However
,
we
know
that
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
kitchen
,
and
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
garden
.
This
suggests
that
the
bedroom
is
likely
to
be
adjacent
to
the
east
of
the
kitchen
.
Since
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
kitchen
,
it
is
likely
that
the
bedroom
is
west
of
the
hallway
.
