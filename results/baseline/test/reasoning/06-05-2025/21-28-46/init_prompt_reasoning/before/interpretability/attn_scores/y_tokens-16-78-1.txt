Reason
ing
:
Since
Brian
is
a
frog
(
from
sentence

1
),
and
Julius
is
also
a
frog
(
from
sentence

1
),
we
can
infer
that
Brian
's
color
is
likely
to
be
similar
to
Julius
's
color
,
which
is
gray
(
from
sentence

2
).
However
,
we
don
't
have
any
direct
information
about
Brian
's
color
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
consider
the
possibility
that
Brian
's
color
might
be
different
from
Julius
's
.
Answer

Gray
