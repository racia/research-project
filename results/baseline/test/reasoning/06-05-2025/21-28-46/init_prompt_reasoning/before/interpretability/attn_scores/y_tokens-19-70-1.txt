Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bedroom
is
north
of
the
bathroom
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
garden
is
north
of
the
hallway
(
sentence

2
),
it
implies
that
the
hallway
is
not
directly
north
of
the
bathroom
.
Additionally
,
the
kitchen
is
south
of
the
hallway
(
sentence

4
),
and
the
garden
is
south
of
the
bathroom
(
sentence

5
).
This
suggests
that
the
bathroom
is
not
directly
south
of
the
hallway
either
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
consider
the
relative
positions
of
the
bedroom
and
the
bathroom
