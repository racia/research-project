Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bathroom
is
west
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

2
),
and
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
kitchen
(
sentence

3
),
we
can
infer
that
the
hallway
is
not
directly
adjacent
to
the
bathroom
.
However
,
the
bathroom
is
south
of
the
garden
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
bedroom
is
north
of
the
hallway
(
sentence

4
).
This
suggests
that
the
bathroom
is
west
of
the
bedroom
,
which
is
north
of
the
hallway
.
Therefore
,
to
go
from
the
hallway
to
the
bathroom
