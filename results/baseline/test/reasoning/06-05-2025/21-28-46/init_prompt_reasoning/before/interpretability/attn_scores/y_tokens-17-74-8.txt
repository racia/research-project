Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
that
the
triangle
is
below
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
triangle
is
below
the
red
sphere
,
it
's
likely
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
triangle
.
Additionally
,
we
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
yellow
square
is
above
the
triangle
.
Therefore
,
it
's
likely
that
the
red
sphere
is
also
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
