Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bathroom
is
north
of
the
hallway
(
sentence

3
),
and
the
kitchen
is
west
of
the
bathroom
(
sentence

4
),
we
can
conclude
that
the
bathroom
is
not
directly
adjacent
to
the
garden
.
However
,
the
garden
is
west
of
the
kitchen
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
kitchen
is
north
of
the
office
(
sentence

2
).
Since
the
bedroom
is
north
of
the
garden
(
sentence

5
),
we
can
infer
that
the
garden
is
east
of
the
bedroom
.
