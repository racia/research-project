Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
yellow
square
.
Since
the
triangle
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
(
sentence

1
),
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
above
the
yellow
square
.
Also
,
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

2
),
which
means
the
yellow
square
is
not
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
This
information
does
not
directly
imply
the
relation
between
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
yellow
square
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
pink
