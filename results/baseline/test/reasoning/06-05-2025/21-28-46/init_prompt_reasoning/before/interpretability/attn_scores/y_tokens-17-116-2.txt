Reason
ing
:
The
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
.
This
means
that
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
triangle
.
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
triangle
,
it
is
possible
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
blue
square
as
well
.
However
,
we
cannot
conclude
that
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
without
additional
information
.
