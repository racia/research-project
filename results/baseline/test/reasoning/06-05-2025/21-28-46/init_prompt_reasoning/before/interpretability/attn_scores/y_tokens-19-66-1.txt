Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
garden
,
and
the
office
is
south
of
the
garden
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
office
.
However
,
we
need
to
find
the
direction
from
the
bedroom
to
the
office
.
Since
the
bedroom
is
north
of
the
bathroom
,
and
the
office
is
south
of
the
garden
,
we
can
infer
that
the
bedroom
is
north
of
the
office
.
Therefore
,
to
go
from
the
bedroom
to
the
office
,
we
need
to
move
south
.
Answer

south
