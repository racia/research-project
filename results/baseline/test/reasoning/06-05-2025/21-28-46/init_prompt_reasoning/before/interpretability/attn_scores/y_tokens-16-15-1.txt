Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Lily
,
and
since
Lily
is
a
rh
ino
(
from
sentence

5
),
we
can
infer
that
Lily
's
color
is
not
mentioned
in
the
given
context
.
However
,
we
can
look
for
any
information
about
Lily
's
color
in
the
context
sentences
.
Since
Lily
is
not
mentioned
again
in
any
of
the
sentences
,
we
cannot
find
any
specific
information
about
Lily
's
color
.
