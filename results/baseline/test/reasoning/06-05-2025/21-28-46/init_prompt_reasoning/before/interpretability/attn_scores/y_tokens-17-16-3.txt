Reason
ing
:
The
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
red
square
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
Since
the
triangle
is
not
directly
related
to
the
red
square
in
terms
of
vertical
position
,
we
cannot
conclude
that
the
triangle
is
above
or
below
the
red
square
.
The
triangle
's
position
is
only
specified
as
being
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
which
is
below
the
red
square
.
