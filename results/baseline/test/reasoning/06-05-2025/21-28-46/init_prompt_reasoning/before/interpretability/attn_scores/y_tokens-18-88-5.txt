Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
if
the
chest
fits
in
the
chocolate
.
However
,
the
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
information
that
suggests
the
chocolate
has
a
size
or
shape
that
would
allow
the
chest
to
fit
inside
it
.
In
fact
,
the
sentences
suggest
that
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
(
from
previous
questions
).
Therefore
,
it
is
not
possible
for
the
chest
to
fit
inside
the
chocolate
.
