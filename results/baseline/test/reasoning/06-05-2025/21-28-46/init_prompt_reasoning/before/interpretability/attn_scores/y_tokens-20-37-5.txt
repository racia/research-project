Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
previous
information
about
Jason
's
actions
or
preferences
,
and
the
context
sentence
only
provides
information
about
Jason
's
current
action
(
travel
ing
to
the
garden
).
However
,
based
on
the
previous
context
,
Jason
was
thirsty
and
went
to
the
kitchen
.
It
is
unlikely
that
Jason
would
go
to
the
garden
for
the
same
reason
,
as
the
context
sentence
suggests
that
Jason
has
changed
his
destination
.

Not
