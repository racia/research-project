Reason
ing
:
Since
Julius
is
a
lion
(
sentence

9
),
and
lions
are
not
typically
yellow
(
as
Lily
is
yellow
,
but
a
lion
),
and
not
gray
(
as
Bern
hard
is
gray
,
but
a
frog
),
and
not
green
(
as
Brian
is
green
,
but
a
rh
ino
),
the
most
logical
inference
is
that
Julius
is
not
mentioned
to
have
a
specific
color
.
Answer

Not
mentioned
