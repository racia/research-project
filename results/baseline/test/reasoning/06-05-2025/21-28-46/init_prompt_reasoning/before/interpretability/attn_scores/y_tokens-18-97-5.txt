Reason
ing
:
None
of
the
sentences
directly
compare
the
size
of
the
box
of
chocolates
and
the
chest
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
box
of
chocolates
is
smaller
than
the
box
(
from
sentence

1
),
and
the
box
is
smaller
than
the
chest
(
from
sentence

3
).
Therefore
,
it
is
logical
to
conclude
that
the
box
of
chocolates
is
smaller
than
the
chest
.
