Reason
ing
:
The
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
and
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
blue
square
.
This
information
does
not
directly
mention
the
position
of
the
yellow
square
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
However
,
since
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
blue
square
,
and
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
it
is
possible
to
infer
that
the
yellow
square
is
not
below
the
blue
square
.
