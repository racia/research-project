Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Lily
,
who
is
a
lion
according
to
sentence

1
.
Since
Lily
's
color
is
not
mentioned
in
the
given
context
,
we
need
to
infer
it
based
on
the
information
provided
.
Julius
,
who
is
also
a
lion
(
Bern
hard
is
a
lion
,
and
Bern
hard
is
gray
),
is
white
.
However
,
Lily
is
not
Julius
,
and
there
is
no
mention
of
Lily
's
color
being
different
from
Julius
'.
Therefore
,
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
Lily
