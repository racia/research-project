Reason
ing
:
Since
Greg
is
a
rh
ino
(
sentence

4
),
and
Julius
,
who
is
also
a
rh
ino
,
is
yellow
(
sentence

8
),
it
's
likely
that
Greg
's
color
is
not
mentioned
in
the
context
sentences
.
However
,
since
Lily
,
who
is
a
different
type
of
animal
(
frog
),
is
gray
(
sentence

5
),
it
's
possible
that
Greg
's
color
is
also
gray
,
but
there
's
no
direct
evidence
to
support
this
.
