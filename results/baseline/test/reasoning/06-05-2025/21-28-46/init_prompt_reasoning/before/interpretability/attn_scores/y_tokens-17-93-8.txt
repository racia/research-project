states
that
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
.
This
implies
that
the
yellow
square
is
not
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
but
it
does
not
provide
any
information
about
the
relative
position
of
the
blue
square
and
the
yellow
square
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
yellow
square
is
not
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
since
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
blue
square
is
not
mentioned
in
this
context
