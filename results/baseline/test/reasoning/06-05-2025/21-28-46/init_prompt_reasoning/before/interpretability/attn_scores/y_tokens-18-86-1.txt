Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
if
the
chest
fits
inside
the
chocolate
.
However
,
the
context
sentences
do
not
mention
the
chocolate
having
a
size
or
shape
that
could
accommodate
the
chest
.
In
fact
,
the
chocolate
fits
inside
the
box
,
which
fits
inside
the
chest
.
This
implies
that
the
chocolate
is
much
smaller
than
the
chest
.
Therefore
,
it
is
not
possible
for
the
chest
to
fit
inside
the
chocolate
.

No
