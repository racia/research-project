Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
(
from
sentence

1
).
We
also
know
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
(
from
sentence

2
).
Since
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
we
can
't
conclude
anything
about
the
red
sphere
's
position
relative
to
the
yellow
square
.
