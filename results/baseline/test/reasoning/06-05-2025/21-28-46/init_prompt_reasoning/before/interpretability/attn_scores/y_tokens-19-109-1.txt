Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bedroom
is
west
of
the
office
,
and
the
bathroom
is
west
of
the
bedroom
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
bathroom
is
west
of
the
office
as
well
.
Additionally
,
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
bathroom
,
which
means
that
the
bathroom
is
not
directly
north
of
the
bedroom
.
Therefore
,
to
go
from
the
bedroom
to
the
bathroom
,
we
need
to
go
west
first
.
Answer

west
