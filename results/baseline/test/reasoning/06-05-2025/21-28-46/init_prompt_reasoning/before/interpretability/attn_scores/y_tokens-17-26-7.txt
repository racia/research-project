Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

1
).
We
also
know
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
(
from
sentence

2

Since
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
red
sphere
is
indeed
to
the

the
yellow
