Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
red
square
,
it
implies
that
the
red
square
is
not
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
The
yellow
square
's
position
relative
to
the
red
square
doesn
't
provide
information
about
the
red
square
's
position
relative
to
the
red
sphere
.
