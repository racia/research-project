Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
mention
the
chocolate
as
a
container
that
can
hold
the
chest
.

the
chocolate
is
mentioned
as
something
that
fits
inside
the
suitcase
(
sentence

1
)
and
the
box
of
chocolates
(
sentence

6
).
This
implies
that
the

is
a
small
object
,
and
it
is
unlikely
that
the
chest
can
fit
inside
it
.
