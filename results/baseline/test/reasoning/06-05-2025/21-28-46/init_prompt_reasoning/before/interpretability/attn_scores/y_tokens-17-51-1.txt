The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
yellow

.
Since
the
triangle
is

the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
(
sentence

1
),
it
implies
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
on
the
left
side
.
Similarly
,
the
triangle
is
above

which
means
the
yellow
square
is
not
on
the
top
.
The
question
asks

the

.
Therefore
