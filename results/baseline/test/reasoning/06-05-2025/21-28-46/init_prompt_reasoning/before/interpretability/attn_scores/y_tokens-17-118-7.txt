Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
mention
that
the
triangle
is

square
,
but
they
do
not
provide
any

about
the
yellow
square
's
position

Since
the
triangle

to
the
yellow
square
is
known
,
but
not
its
position
relative
to
the
red
sphere
,
we
cannot
determine
the
yellow
square
's
position
relative
to
the
red
sphere
.
