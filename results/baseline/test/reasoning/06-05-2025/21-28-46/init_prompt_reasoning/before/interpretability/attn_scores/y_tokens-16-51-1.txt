Reason
ing
:
Bern
hard
is
a
sw
an
,
and
there
is
no
information
about
the
color
of
a
sw
an
in
the
given
context
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Bern
hard
is
not
green
,
as
Lily
is
a
frog
and
is
green
,
and
Bern
hard
is
not
a
frog
.
Similarly
,
Bern
hard
is
not
white
,
as
Julius
is
a
frog
and
is
white
,
and
Bern
hard
is
not
a
frog
.
We
also
know
that
Bern
hard
is
not
gray
,
as
Greg
is
a
rh
ino
and
