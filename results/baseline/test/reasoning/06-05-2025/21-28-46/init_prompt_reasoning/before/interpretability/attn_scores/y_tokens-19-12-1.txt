Reason
ing
:
Since
the
kitchen
is
south
of
the
bedroom
,
and
the
garden
is
south
of
the
office
,
we
can
infer
that
the
office
is
north
of
the
kitchen
.
Additionally
,
the
hallway
is
south
of
the
kitchen
,
which
means
it
's
not
the
direct
path
to
the
office
.
The
only
remaining
option
is
to
go
north
from
the
kitchen
to
reach
the
office
.
Answer

north
