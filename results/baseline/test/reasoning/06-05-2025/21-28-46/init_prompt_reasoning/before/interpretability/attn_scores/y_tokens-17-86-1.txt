Reason
ing
:
The
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
which
means
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
.
The
yellow
square
is
also
below
the
red
square
.
Since
the
blue
square
is
not
mentioned
in
relation
to
the
red
square
,
we
cannot
directly
conclude
its
position
relative
to
the
red
square
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
blue
square
is
not
above
the
red
square
,
as
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
red
square
and
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
