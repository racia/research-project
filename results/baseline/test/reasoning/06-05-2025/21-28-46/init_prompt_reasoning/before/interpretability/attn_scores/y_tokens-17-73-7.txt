Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
triangle
and
the
red
sphere
.
From
the
previous
context
,
we
know
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
red
sphere
and
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
This
implies
that
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
it
means
that
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
However
,
there
is
no
direct
information
about
the
relation
between
the
triangle
and
the
red
sphere
