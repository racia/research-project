Reason
ing
:
The
red
square
is
below
the
red
sphere
,
and
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
This
implies
that
the
red
square
is
below
the
red
sphere
,
but
there
is
no
direct
information
about
the
yellow
square
's
position
relative
to
the
red
square
.
However
,
since
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
it
is
possible
that
the
yellow
square
is
above
the
red
square
.
