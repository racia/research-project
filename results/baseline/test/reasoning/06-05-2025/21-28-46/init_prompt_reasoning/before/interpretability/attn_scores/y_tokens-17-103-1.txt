Reason
ing
:
The
yellow
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
Since
the
yellow
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
,
it
is
not
directly
related
to
the
triangle
's
position
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
which
means
it
is
not
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
.
