Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
(
from
sentence

1
).
Since
the
blue
square
is
below
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

2
),
it
implies
that
the
red
square
is
above
the
blue
square
.
Therefore
,
the
triangle
(
which
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
)
is
also
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
