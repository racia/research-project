ing
:
We
already
established
in
a
previous
answer
that
the
chocolate

inside
the
box
of
chocolates
(
from
sentence

1
),
and
the
box
of
chocolates
fits
inside
the
container
(
from
sentence

4
).
Since
the
chocolate
fits
inside
the
box
of
chocolates
,
and
the
box
of
chocolates
fits
inside
the
container
,
it
is
logical

conclude
that
the
chocolate
also
fits
inside
the
container
.
