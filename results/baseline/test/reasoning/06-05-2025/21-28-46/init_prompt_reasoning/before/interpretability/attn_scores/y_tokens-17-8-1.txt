Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relationship
between
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
triangle
.
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

2
),
we
can
infer
that
the
triangle
is
not
directly
related
to
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
(
which
is
below
the
red
square
,
from
sentence

1
).
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
relative
to
the
triangle
.
