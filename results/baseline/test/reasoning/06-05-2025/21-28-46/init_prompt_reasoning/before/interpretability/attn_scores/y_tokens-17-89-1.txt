Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relative
position
of
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
pink
rectangle
(
sentence

2
),
it
means
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
yellow
square
.
However
,
the
question
is
asking
about
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
relative
to
the
red
sphere
,
which
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

1
).
To
determine
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
,
we
need
to
consider
the
yellow
square
's
position
relative
to
the
pink
rectangle
