Reason
ing
:
Since
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
it
means
the
triangle
is
not
on
the
left
most
side
.
Also
,
the
blue
square
is
below
the
red
square
,
which
implies
the
red
square
is
above
the
blue
square
.
Comb
ining
these
two
facts
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
triangle
is
not
on
the
left
most
side
and
is
not
above
the
red
square
.
Therefore
,
the
triangle
must
be
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
.
