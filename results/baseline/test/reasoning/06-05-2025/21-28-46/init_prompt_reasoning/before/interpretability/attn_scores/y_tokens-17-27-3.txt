Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
red
square
.
Since
the
red
sphere
's
position
is
only
known
to
be
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
red
square
's
position
is
only
known
to
be
below
the
pink
rectangle
(
sentence

2
),
we
cannot
determine
if
the
red
sphere
is
above
or
below
the
red
square
.
The
information
provided
does
not
allow
us
to
make
a
conclusion
about
their
vertical
positions
.
