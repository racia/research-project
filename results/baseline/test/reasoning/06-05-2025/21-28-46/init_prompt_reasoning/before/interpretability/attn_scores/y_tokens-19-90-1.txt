Reason
ing
:
Since
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

2
),
and
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
kitchen
(
sentence

5
),
we
can
infer
that
the
bedroom
and
the
kitchen
are
not
directly
adjacent
.
Additionally
,
the
kitchen
is
north
of
the
office
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
bedroom
is
not
mentioned
in
relation
to
the
office
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
find
a
path
from
the
bedroom
to
the
kitchen
.
Answer
:
east
,
then
north
