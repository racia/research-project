Reason
ing
:
The
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
.
We
cannot
directly
determine
the
relationship
between
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
blue
square
.
However
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
below
the
blue
square
,
since
the
triangle
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
