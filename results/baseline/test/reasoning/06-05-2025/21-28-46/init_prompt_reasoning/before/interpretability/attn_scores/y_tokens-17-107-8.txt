Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
red
square
.
Since
the
blue
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
(
sentence

2
),
it
implies
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
blue
square
.
However
,
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
(
sentence

1
),
which
doesn
't
provide
any
information
about
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
relative
to
the
red
square
.
We
need
more
information
to
determine
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
relative
to
the
red
square
.
