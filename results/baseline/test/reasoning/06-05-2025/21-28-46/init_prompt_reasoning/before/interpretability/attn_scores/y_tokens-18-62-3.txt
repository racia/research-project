Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
,
and
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
.
However
,
we
don
't
have
any
direct
information
about
the
relationship
between
the
chocolate
and
the
suitcase
.
Since
the
chest
fits
inside
the
suitcase
,
and
the
box
fits
inside
the
suitcase
,
we
can
infer
that
the
chocolate
is
smaller
than
the
suitcase
.
