Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
bathroom
,
and
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
bedroom
,
the
bedroom
is
also
east
of
the
hallway
.
This
means
that
the
bedroom
is
not
directly
adjacent
to
the
kitchen
,
which
is
west
of
the
garden
.
However
,
the
office
is
south
of
the
bedroom
and
north
of
the
kitchen
,
which
implies
that
the
bedroom
and
kitchen
are
not
directly
adjacent
either
.
The
only
way
to
reach
the
kitchen
from
the
bedroom
is
to
go
west
,
since
the
kitchen
is
west
