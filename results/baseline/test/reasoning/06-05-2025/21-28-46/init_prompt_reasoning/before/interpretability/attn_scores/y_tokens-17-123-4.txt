Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
spatial
relationship
between
the
red
square
and
the
pink
rectangle
.
From
the
previous
context
sentences
,
we
know
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
red
square
.
This
means
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
red
square
.
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
red
square
,
it
is
not
possible
for
the
red
square
to
be
above
the
pink
