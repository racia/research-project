Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
if
the
container
fits
in
the
chocolate
.
However
,
the
context
sentences
do
not
mention
the
chocolate
as
a
container
or
a
space
where
something
can
fit
.
Instead
,
the
chocolate
is
described
as
something
that
fits
inside
the
box
of
chocolates
,
which
fits
inside
the
container
.
This
suggests
that
the
chocolate
is
an
object
,
not
a
container
.
Therefore
,
it
is
not
possible
for
the
container
to
fit
in
the
chocolate
.
