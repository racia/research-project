Reason
ing
:
Bern
hard
is
a
lion
,
and
Lily
is
also
a
lion
.
Since
Lily
is
green
,
it
's
possible
that
Bern
hard
's
color
is
also
green
,
but
there
's
no
direct
information
about
Bern
hard
's
color
.
However
,
since
Bern
hard
is
a
lion
,
and
lions
are
typically
not
green
,
it
's
more
likely
that
Bern
hard
's
color
is
not
specified
.
