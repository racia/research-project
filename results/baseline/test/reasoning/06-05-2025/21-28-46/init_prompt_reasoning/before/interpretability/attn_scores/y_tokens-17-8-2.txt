Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
mention
of
the
triangle
's
position
relative
to
the
pink
rectangle
in
the
given
context
sentences
.
The
sentences
only
provide
information
about
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
(
below
the
red
square
)
and
the
triangle
's
position
(
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
).
Since
there
is
no
direct
connection
between
the
triangle
and
the
pink
rectangle
,
we
cannot
determine
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
relative
to
the
triangle
.
