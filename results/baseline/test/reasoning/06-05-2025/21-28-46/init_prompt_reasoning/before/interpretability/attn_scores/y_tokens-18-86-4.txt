Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
direct
information
about
the
size
of
the
chocolate
compared
to
the
chest
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
chocolate
fits
inside
the
box
,
and
the
box
fits
inside
the
chest
.
This
implies
that
the
chocolate
is
smaller
than
the
box
,
and
the
box
is
smaller
than
the
chest
.
Therefore
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
chocolate
is
not
bigger
than
the
chest
.
