Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
bathroom
(
sentence

3
),
and
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
office
(
sentence

4
),
and
the
office
is
east
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

5
),
we
can
conclude
that
the
bedroom
and
the
hallway
share
a
common
direction
,
which
is
east
.
Additionally
,
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
bathroom
,
and
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
garden
(
sentence

1
),
which
implies
that
the
hallway
is
not
directly
adjacent
to
the
bedroom
.
Therefore
