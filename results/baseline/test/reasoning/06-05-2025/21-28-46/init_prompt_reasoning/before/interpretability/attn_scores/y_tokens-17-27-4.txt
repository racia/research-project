Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
red
square
.
Sentence

1
states
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
but
it
does
not
provide
any
information
about
the
red
square
's
position
relative
to
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
red
square
's
position
is
only
known
to
be
below
the
pink
rectangle
(
sentence

2
),
we
cannot
determine
if
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
or

the
red
