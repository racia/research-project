Reason
ing
:
The
triangle
is
above
the
red
sphere
,
which
means
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
triangle
.
The
triangle
is
also
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
but
this
information
does
not
provide
any
direct
relation
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
blue
square
.
Since
the
triangle
is
above
the
red
sphere
,
the
blue
square
(
which
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
)
cannot
be
below
the
red
sphere
.
Answer
:
No
,
the
blue
square
is
not
below
the
red
sphere
.
