Reason
ing
:
According
to
the
context
sentences
,
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
(
sentence

1
)
and
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
(
sentence

2
).
This
implies
that
the
blue
square
and
the
pink
rectangle
are
not
adjacent
to
each
other
,
and
the
triangle
is
in
between
them
.
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
it
means
that
the
blue
square
cannot
be
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
