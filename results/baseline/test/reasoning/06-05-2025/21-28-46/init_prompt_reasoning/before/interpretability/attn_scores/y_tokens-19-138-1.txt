Reason
ing
:
Since
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

4
),
it
is
not
directly
adjacent
to
the
garden
.
However
,
the
kitchen
is
south
of
the
garden
(
sentence

3
),
and
the
hallway
is
south
of
the
kitchen
(
sentence

5
).
This
implies
that
the
hallway
is
south
of
the
garden
,
which
means
we
need
to
move
south
from
the
hallway
to
reach
the
garden
.
