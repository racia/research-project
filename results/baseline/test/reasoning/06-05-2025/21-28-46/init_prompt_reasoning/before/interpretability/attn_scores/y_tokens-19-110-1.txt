Reason
ing
:
Since
the
kitchen
is
south
of
the
office
(
sentence

4
),
and
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
garden
(
sentence

3
),
we
can
infer
that
the
kitchen
is
not
directly
adjacent
to
the
garden
.
However
,
the
bathroom
is
west
of
the
garden
(
sentence

5
),
and
the
kitchen
is
south
of
the
bathroom
(
sentence

1
).
This
means
that
to
get
from
the
kitchen
to
the
garden
,
we
need
to
go
west
to
the
bathroom
and
then
east
to
the
garden
.
