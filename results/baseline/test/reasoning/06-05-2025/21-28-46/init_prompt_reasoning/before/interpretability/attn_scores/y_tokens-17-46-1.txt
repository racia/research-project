Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
yellow
square
and
the
red
sphere
.
We
know
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

1
)
and
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
(
sentence

2
).
This
means
that
the
yellow
square
and
the
red
sphere
are
not
adjacent
to
each
other
.
There
is
no
information
about
the
vertical
position
of
the
yellow
square
or
the
red
sphere
,
so
we
cannot
determine
if
the
yellow
square
is
above
or
below
the
red
