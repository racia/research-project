Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
(
from
sentence

2
).
We
also
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
(
from
sentence

1
).
Since
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
,
it
means
that
the
yellow
square
(
which
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
)
is
also
above
the
pink
rectangle
.
Therefore
,
the
yellow
square
cannot
be
below
the
pink
rectangle
.
