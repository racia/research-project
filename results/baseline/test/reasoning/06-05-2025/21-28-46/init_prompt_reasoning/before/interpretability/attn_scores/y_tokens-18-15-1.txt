Reason
ing
:
From
the
given
context
sentences
,
we
know
that
the
chocolate
is
smaller
than
the
box
(
1
),
and
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
(
5
).
We
also
know
that
the
box
of
chocolates
fits
inside
the
suitcase
(
4
),
and
the
box
fits
inside
the
suitcase
(
not
explicitly
stated
,
but
can
be
inferred
).
This
implies
that
the
box
is
smaller
than
the
suitcase
.
Since
the
chocolate
fits
inside
the
box
(
7
),
it
is
also
smaller
than
the
box
.
Therefore
,
