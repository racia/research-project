Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

1
),
but
this
information
doesn
't
directly
relate
to
the
red
square
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
We
also
know
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
(
from
sentence

2
),
but
this
information
doesn
't
provide
any
information
about
the
red
square
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
either
.
Since
there
is
no
direct
information
about
the
red
square
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
