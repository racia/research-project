:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Greg
,
who
is
a
rh
ino
according
to
sentence

6
.
Since
there
is
no
mention
of
Greg
's
color
in
the
given
sentences
,
we
need
to
infer
it
logically
.
We
know
that
Bern
hard
is
white
(
sentence

3
),
but
Bern
hard
is
a
frog
,
not
a
rh
ino
.
Similarly
,
Brian
is
white
(
sentence

7
),
but
Brian
is
a
frog
,
not
a
rh
ino
.
Julius
is
gray
(
sentence

9
),
but
