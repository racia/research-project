From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
blue
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
We
don
't
have
any
information
about
the
relationship
between
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
red
sphere
.
Since
we
don
't
have
any
direct
information
about
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
relative
to
the
red
sphere
,
we
cannot
determine
if
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
red
sphere
.
