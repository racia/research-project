The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
yellow
square
and
the
red
square
.
We
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
yellow
square
(
from
sentence

1
),
but
we
don
't
have
any
direct
information
about
the
position
of
the
yellow
square
relative
to
the
red
square
.

,
we
do
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

2
).
This
implies
that
the
red
sphere
is
not
above
the
red
square
,
because
if
it
were
,
it
