Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Brian
,
who
is
a
rh
ino
according
to
sentence

2
.
Since
Lily
,
also
a
rh
ino
,
is
white
according
to
sentence

3
,
it
's
possible
that
Brian
's
color
is
also
white
.
However
,
there
's
no
direct
information
about
Brian
's
color
in
the
given
sentences
.
We
can
infer
that
Brian
's
color
might
be
white
,
but
we
can
't
be
certain
.
