Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
that
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
(
from
sentence

1
).
Since
the
blue
square
is
below
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

2
),
it
implies
that
the
red
square
is
above
the
blue
square
.
Therefore
,
the
red
square
cannot
be
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
as
it
would
be
above
the
blue
square
,
which
is
already
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
