Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
(
from
sentence

1
),
and
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

2
).
Since
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
both
the
red
sphere
and
the
red
square
,
the
red
sphere
must
be
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
Therefore
,
the
red
square
cannot
be
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
.
