:
The
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
red
square
.
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
red
square
,
it
implies
that
the
red
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
.
However
,
we
cannot
conclude
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
or
right
of
the
triangle
,
as
the
triangle
's
position
is
only
specified
as
being
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
which
is
