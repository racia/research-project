ing
:
Since
Jason
travelled
to
the
garden
,
it
is
likely

a
specific
reason

in
the
previous

Jason
was
thirsty
and
went
to
the
kitchen
.
This
suggests
that
Jason
's
original
intention
was
to
qu
ench
his
thirst
,
but
since
he
travelled
to
the
garden
instead
,
it
is
likely
that
he
changed
his
mind
or
was
influenced
by
something
.
