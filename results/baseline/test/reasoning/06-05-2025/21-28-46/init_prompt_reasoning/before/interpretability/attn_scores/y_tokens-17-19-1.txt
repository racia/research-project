Reason
ing
:
The
red
square
is
below
the
red
sphere
,
and
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
Since
the
red
square
is
below
the
red
sphere
,
it
is
not
directly
related
to
the
pink
rectangle
.
However
,
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
which
implies
that
the
red
square
,
being
below
the
red
sphere
,
is
also
below
the
pink
rectangle
.
