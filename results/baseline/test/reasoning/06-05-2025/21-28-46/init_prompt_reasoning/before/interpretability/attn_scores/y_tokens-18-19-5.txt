Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
information
about
the
box
fitting
inside
the
chocolate
.
The
sentences
only
describe
the
relationships
between
the
box
,
container
,
and
suitcase
,
but
do
not
mention
the
box
fitting
inside
the
chocolate
.
Additionally
,
the
sentences
state
that
the
chocolate
fits
inside
the
box
(
sentence

2
),
which
implies
that
the
box
is
larger
than
the
chocolate
.
Therefore
,
it
is
unlikely
that
the
box
fits
inside
the
chocolate
.
