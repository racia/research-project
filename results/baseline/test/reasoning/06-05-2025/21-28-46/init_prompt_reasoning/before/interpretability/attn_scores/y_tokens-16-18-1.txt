:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Brian
,
who
is
a
rh
ino
according
to
sentence

3
.
Since
the
color
of
rh
inos
is
not
mentioned
in
the
given
context
,
we
need
to
infer
it
logically
.
We
can
do
this
by
comparing
Brian
with
Greg
,
who
is
also
a
rh
ino
and
has
a
specific
color
mentioned
in
sentence

5
,
which
is
green
.
However
,
we
cannot
directly
conclude
that
Brian
's
color
is
also
green
because
there
is
no
direct
information
about
Brian
's
color
