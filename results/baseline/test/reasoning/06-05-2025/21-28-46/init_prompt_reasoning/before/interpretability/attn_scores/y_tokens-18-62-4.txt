Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
box
fits
inside
the
suitcase
,
and
the
chest
fits
inside
the
suitcase
.
However
,
we
don
't
have
any
information
about
the
box
of
chocolates
.
Since
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
,
and
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
,
we
can
infer
that
the
box
of
chocolates
is
smaller
than
the
box
.
Therefore
,
the
suitcase
,
which
is
bigger
than
the
box
,
cannot
fit
inside
the
box
of
chocolates
.
