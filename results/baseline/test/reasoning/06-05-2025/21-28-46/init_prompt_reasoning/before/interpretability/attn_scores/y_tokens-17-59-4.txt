Reason
ing
:
The
triangle
is
above
the
yellow
square
(
from
sentence

).
The
yellow
square
is
to
the

of
the
blue
square
(
from
sentence

2

Since
the
triangle
is
above
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
blue
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
(
not
directly
above
or
below
),
we
cannot
conclude
that
the
blue
square
is
below
the
triangle
.
