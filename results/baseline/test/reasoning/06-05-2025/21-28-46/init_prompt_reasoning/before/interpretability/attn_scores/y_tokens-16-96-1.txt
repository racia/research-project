Reason
ing
:
Since
Lily
is
a
frog
(
sentence

6
),
and
frogs
are
not
typically
associated
with
a
specific
color
,
we
cannot
infer
a
specific
color
for
Lily
.
However
,
we
can
consider
the
colors
of
the
other
frogs
mentioned
:
Greg
is
green
(
sentence

9
),
and
Lily
is
not
mentioned
as
having
a
specific
color
.
Therefore
,
we
can
assume
that
Lily
is
likely
green
,
as
it
is
the
only
color
mentioned
for
frogs
in
the
context
.

green
