Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Bern
hard
,
who
is
a
frog
according
to
sentence

9
.
Since
the
color
of
a
frog
is
not
mentioned
in
the
given
context
,
we
need
to
make
an
assumption
.
However
,
since
Greg
is
a
frog
and
is
gray
according
to
sentence

3
,
it
's
logical
to
assume
that
Bern
hard
,
being
a
frog
as
well
,
is
also
gray
.
Answer
:
gray
