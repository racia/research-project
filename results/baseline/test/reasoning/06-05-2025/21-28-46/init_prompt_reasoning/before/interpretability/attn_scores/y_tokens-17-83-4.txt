Reason
ing
:
The
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
but
there
is
no
information
about
the
position
of
the
red
square
relative
to
the
triangle
.
Since
the
red
square
is
above
the
red
sphere
,
it
is
not
directly
related
to
the
triangle
.
We
cannot
determine
if
the
red
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
without
additional
information
.
