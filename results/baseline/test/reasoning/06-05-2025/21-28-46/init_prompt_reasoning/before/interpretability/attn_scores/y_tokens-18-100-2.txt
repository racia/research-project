Reason
ing
:
The
suitcase
is
bigger
than
the
chest
,
and
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.
This
means
the
suitcase
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.
However
,
the
question
asks
if
the
suitcase
fits
in
the
box
of
chocolates
,
not
if
it
's
bigger
.
The
box
of
chocolates
is
smaller
than
the
suitcase
,
and
the
suitcase
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.
Since
the
suitcase
is
bigger
,
it
cannot
fit
inside
the
box
of
chocolates
.
