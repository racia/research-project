Reason
ing
:
We
don
't
have
any
direct
information
about
the
red
square
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
The
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
(
sentence

1
),
but
this
doesn
't
provide
any
information
about
the
vertical
position
.
The
pink
rectangle
is
also
below
the
red
square
(
sentence

2
),
but
this
doesn
't
help
us
determine
the
red
square
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
