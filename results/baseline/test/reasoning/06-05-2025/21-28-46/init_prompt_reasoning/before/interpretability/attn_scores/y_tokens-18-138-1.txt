Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
suggest
that
the
chocolate
is
smaller
than
the
suitcase
,
as
it
fits
inside
the
suitcase
.
The
suitcase
is
also
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
,
and
the
chocolate
fits
inside
the
box
of
chocolates
.
This
implies
that
the
chocolate
is
smaller
than
the
box
of
chocolates
,
and
since
the
box
of
chocolates
fits
inside
the
suitcase
,
the
chocolate
must
fit
inside
the
suitcase
as
well
.
Therefore
,
the
chocolate
is
not
bigger
than
the
suitcase
.
