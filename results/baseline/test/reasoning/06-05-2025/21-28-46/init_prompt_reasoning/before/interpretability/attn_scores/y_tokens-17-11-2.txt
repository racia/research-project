Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
red
sphere
.
We
know
that
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
(
from
sentence

1
).
Since
the
blue
square
is
below
the
pink
rectangle
(
from
sentence

2
),
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
blue
square
.
This
implies
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
as
the
blue
square
is
.
Therefore
,
the
pink
rectangle
is
likely
to
be
to
the
right
of
the
