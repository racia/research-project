Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
(
sentence

1
).
Since
the
red
sphere
is
also
below
the
red
square
(
sentence

2
),
we
can
infer
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
,
as
it
would
be
above
the
red
square
,
which
is
not
mentioned
.
