Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
previous
information
about
Y
ann
's
actions
or
preferences
,
so
we
cannot
make
an
assumption
about
where
Y
ann
will
go
.
The
context
sentence
only
provides
information
about
Y
ann
's
current
state
(
being
hungry
),
but
it
does
not
provide
any
information
about
what
Y
ann
will
do
next
.
Answer
:
Not
enough
information
to
answer
.
