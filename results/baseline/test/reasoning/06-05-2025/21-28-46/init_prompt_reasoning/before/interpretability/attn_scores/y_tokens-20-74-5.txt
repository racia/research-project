Reason
ing
:
Since
Y
ann
went
to
the
garden
,
it
is
likely
that
he
went
there
for
a
reason
.
The
previous
context
sentence
mentioned
that
Y
ann
was
bored
,
and
going
to
the
garden
might
be
a
way
to
alleviate
his
boredom
.
Additionally
,
the
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
other
information
about
Y
ann
's
motivations
,
so
I
will
rely
on
the
assumption
that
his
boredom
was
the
reason
for
his
movement
.
Answer

bored
