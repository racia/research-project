Reason
ing
:
The
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
below
the
red
sphere
.
This

provide
information
about
the
relation
between
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
triangle
is
below
the
red
sphere
,
it
is
possible
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
red
sphere
,
but
there
is
no
direct
information
to
confirm
this
.
