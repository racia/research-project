Reason
ing
:
The
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
but
this
information
does
not
provide
any
direct
relation
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
blue
square
.
The
triangle
is
also
above
the
red
sphere
,
which
means
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
triangle
.
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
the
red
sphere
(
which
is
below
the
triangle
)
cannot
be
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
.
Therefore
,
the
red
sphere
can
be
either
to
the
right
or
below
the
blue
