Reason
ing
:
The
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
.
This
means
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
triangle
,
but
we
cannot
conclude
the
relative
position
of
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
blue
square
.
However
,
since
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
it
is
possible
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
blue
square
as
well
.
