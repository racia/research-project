Reason
ing
:
The
red
sphere
is
below
the
red
square
,
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
Since
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
red
square
,
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
we
can
infer
that
the
red
sphere
is
not
directly
below
the
pink
rectangle
.
However
,
we
don
't
have
any
information
about
the
relative
positions
of
the
red
sphere
and
the
pink
rectangle
in
the
vertical
direction
.
