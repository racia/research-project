Reason
ing
:
Since
the
red
square
is
below
the
triangle
,
it
implies
that
the
triangle
is
above
the
red
square
.
Additionally
,
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
which
means
it
is
not
directly
related
to
the
triangle
's
position
.
Therefore
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
triangle
's
position
is
not
affected
by
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
.
