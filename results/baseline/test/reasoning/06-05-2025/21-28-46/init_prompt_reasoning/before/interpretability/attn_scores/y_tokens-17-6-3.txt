Reason
ing
:
We
know
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
(
from
sentence

1
).
We
also
know
the
red
square
is
below
the
yellow
square
(
from
sentence

2
).
Since
the
blue
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
(
by
inference
),
it
cannot
be
below
the
red
square
,
which
is
below
the
yellow
square
.

no
