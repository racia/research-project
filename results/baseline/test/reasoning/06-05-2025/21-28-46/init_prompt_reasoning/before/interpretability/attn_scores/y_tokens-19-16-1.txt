Reason
ing
:
Since
the
garden
is
north
of
the
bathroom
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

2
),
we
can
infer
that
the
hallway
is
also
north
of
the
garden
.
Additionally
,
the
kitchen
is
west
of
the
hallway
(
sentence

3
),
which
means
that
to
get
to
the
hallway
from
the
garden
,
we
need
to
go
north
and
then
west
.
Answer
