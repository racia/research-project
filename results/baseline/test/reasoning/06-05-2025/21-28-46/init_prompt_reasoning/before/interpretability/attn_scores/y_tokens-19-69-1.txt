Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bathroom
is
east
of
the
hallway
(
sentence

2
),
it
is
not
directly
adjacent
to
the
kitchen
.
However
,
we
know
that
the
bathroom
is
west
of
the
garden
(
sentence

5
),
and
the
garden
is
west
of
the
kitchen
(
sentence

4
).
This
means
that
to
get
from
the
bathroom
to
the
kitchen
,
we
need
to
go
west
from
the
bathroom
,
which
is
the
garden
,
and
then
continue
west
from
the
garden
to
the
kitchen
.
