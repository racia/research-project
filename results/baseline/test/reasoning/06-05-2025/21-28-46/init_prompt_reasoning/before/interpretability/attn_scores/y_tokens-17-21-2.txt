From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
Since
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
it
means
the
red
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
.
Now
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
which
means
it
is
not
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
