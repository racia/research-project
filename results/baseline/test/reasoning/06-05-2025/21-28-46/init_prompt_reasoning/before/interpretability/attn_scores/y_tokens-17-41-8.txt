Reason
ing
:
The
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
,
but
this
information

not
directly
relate
the
yellow

we
can
infer
that
the
yellow
square
is
not
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
and
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
.
This
implies
that
the
yellow
square
is
not
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
