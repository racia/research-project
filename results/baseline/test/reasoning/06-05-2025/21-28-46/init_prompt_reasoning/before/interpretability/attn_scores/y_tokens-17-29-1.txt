:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
blue
square
.
Since
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
(
from
sentence

2
),
and
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
red
sphere
(
from
sentence

1
),
we
need
to
consider
the
spatial
relationships
between
these
entities
.
The
red
sphere
is
above
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
.
This
means
that
the
red
sphere
is
not
directly
related
to
the
blue
square
