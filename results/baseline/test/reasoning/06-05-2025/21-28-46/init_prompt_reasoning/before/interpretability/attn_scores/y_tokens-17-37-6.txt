Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
triangle
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
(
from
sentence

1
),
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
triangle
(
from
sentence

2
),
we
can
infer
that
the
triangle
is
not
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
.
The
triangle
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
,
which
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
.
