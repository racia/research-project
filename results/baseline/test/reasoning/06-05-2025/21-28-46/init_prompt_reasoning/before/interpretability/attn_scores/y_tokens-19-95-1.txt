Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
bathroom
,
and
the
garden
is
west
of
the
office
,
we
can
infer
that
the
bedroom
is
not
directly
adjacent
to
the
garden
.
However
,
we
know
that
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
bedroom
and
south
of
the
garden
.
This
means
that
we
can
go
from
the
bedroom
to
the
hallway
,
and
then
from
the
hallway
to
the
garden
.
