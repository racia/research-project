Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bathroom
is
east
of
the
garden
(
sentence

5
),
and
the
kitchen
is
north
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

3
),
we
can
infer
that
the
kitchen
is
also
north
of
the
bathroom
.
Additionally
,
the
kitchen
is
west
of
the
hallway
(
sentence

2
),
which
means
that
to
go
from
the
bathroom
to
the
kitchen
,
we
need
to
move
east
(
from
the
bathroom
to
the
garden
)
and
then
north
(
from
the
garden
to
the
kitchen
).
Answer
:
east
,
then
north
