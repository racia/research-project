Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
provide
information
about
the
relationships
between
the
entities
,
but
they
do
not
directly
compare
the
size
of
the
chocolate
and
the
chest
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
chest
fits
inside
the
box
(
sentence

4
),
and
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
(
sentence

7
).
This
implies
that
the
chest
is
also
bigger
than
the
chocolate
.
