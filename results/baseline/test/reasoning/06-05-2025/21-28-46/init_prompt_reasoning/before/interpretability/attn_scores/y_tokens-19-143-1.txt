Reason
ing
:
Since
the
kitchen
is
west
of
the
garden
(
sentence

5
),
and
the
bathroom
is
west
of
the
office
(
sentence

3
),
we
can
infer
that
the
kitchen
and
bathroom
are
in
the
same
direction
(
west
).
Additionally
,
the
bathroom
is
south
of
the
garden
(
sentence

1
),
which
means
it
is
also
south
of
the
kitchen
.
Therefore
,
to
go
from
the
kitchen
to
the
bathroom
,
we
need
to
move
south
.
Answer
:
south
