Reason
ing
:
Since
Jason
is
bored
,
he
might
want
to
do
something
to
alleviate
his
boredom
.
However
,
in
the
previous
context
,
Jason
was
thirsty
and
went
to
the
kitchen
.
This
suggests
that
Jason
might
have
a
specific
activity
or
location
in
mind
to
overcome
his
boredom
.
Since
the
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
new
information
,
I
will
make
an
inference
based
on
the
previous
context
.
Answer
:
kitchen
