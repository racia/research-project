Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bathroom
is
east
of
the
hallway
(
sentence

2
),
and
the
bathroom
is
west
of
the
kitchen
(
sentence

3
),
the
bathroom
is
not
directly
adjacent

However
,
the
office
is
north
of
the
kitchen
(
sentence

5

and
the
bathroom
is
west
of
the
kitchen

the
bathroom

one
would
need
to
go
west
from
the
bathroom
to
the
kitchen
,
and
then
north
from
the
kitchen
to
the
office
.
