Reason
ing
:
Since
Greg
is
a
rh
ino
(
sentence

6
),
and
Julius
is
also
a
rh
ino
(
sentence

1
),
we
can
infer
that
Greg
's
color
is
not
specified
in
the
given
context
.
However
,
Julius
's
color
is
yellow
(
sentence

3
),
which
is
not
a
characteristic
that
can
be
directly
applied
to
Greg
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
look
for
another
clue
.
Answer
:
yellow
