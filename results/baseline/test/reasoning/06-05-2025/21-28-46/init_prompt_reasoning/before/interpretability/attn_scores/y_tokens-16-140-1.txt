Reason
ing
:
Since
Julius
is
a
frog
(
sentence

8
),
and
Bern
hard
,
who
is
also
a
frog
,
is
green
(
sentence

7
),
it
's
likely
that
Julius
is
also
green
,
as
frogs
are
typically
green
.
However
,
there
's
no
direct
mention
of
Julius
's
color
.
The
only
information
we
have
is
that
Julius
is
a
frog
,
which
doesn
't
provide
a
specific
color
.
Answer
:
green
