Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
red
square
.
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
red
square
is
below
the
pink
rectangle
(
sentence

2
),
we
can
infer
that
the
red
sphere
and
the
red
square
are
not
directly
related
in
terms
of
their
horizontal
positions
.
The
red
sphere
's
position
is
only
known
to
be
to
the
right
of
something
(
the
pink
rectangle
),
but
not
in
relation
to
the
red
