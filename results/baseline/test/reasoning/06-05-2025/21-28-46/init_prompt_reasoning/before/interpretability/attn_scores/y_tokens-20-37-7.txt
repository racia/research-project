Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
previous
information
about
Y
ann
's
actions
or
preferences
,
and
the
context
sentence
only
provides
information
about
Y
ann
's
current
action
(
going
to
the
kitchen
).
However
,
based
on
the
previous
context
,
Y
ann
was
bored
,
and
it
is
unlikely
that
Y
ann
would
go
to
the
kitchen
for
the
same
reason
,
as
the
context
sentence
suggests
that
Y
ann
has
changed
his
destination
.
