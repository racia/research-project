Reason
ing
:
The
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
and
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
blue
square
.
There
is
no
information
about
the
relation
between
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
red
sphere
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
above
the
red
sphere
,
because
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
blue
square
,
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
.
This
means
that
the
pink
rectangle
cannot
be
above
the
red
sphere
.
