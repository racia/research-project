:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Brian
,
who
is
a
sw
an
according
to
sentence

8
.
Since
Brian
is
a
sw
an
,
we
can
infer
that
his
color
is
not
mentioned
in
the
given
context
sentences
.
However
,
we
can
look
for
any
information
about
sw
ans
in
general
.
Sentence

5
mentions
that
Julius
is
a
sw
an
,
and
sentence

9
states
that
Julius
is
white
.
This
implies
that
sw
ans
are
typically
white
.
Therefore
,
we
can
make
a
logical
assumption
that
