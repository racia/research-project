Reason
ing
:
The
box
of
chocolates
is
not
mentioned
as
a
separate
entity
,
but
rather
as
a
part
of
the
box
.
The
box
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
,
and
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.
This
implies
that
the
box
of
chocolates
is
not
bigger
than
the
box
.
Since
the
container
fits
inside
the
suitcase
,
and
the
box
of
chocolates
is
not
bigger
than
the
container
,
the
box
of
chocolates
is
not
bigger
than
the
suitcase
.
