Sentence

2
states
that
the
box
of
chocolates
fits
inside
the
chest
,
which
implies
that
the
chest
has
a
larger
size
or
capacity
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.
Since
the
chocolate
is
smaller
than
the
box
of
chocolates
(
as
it
is
a
single
piece
of
chocolate
),
it
is
likely
that
the
chocolate
also
fits
inside
the
chest
.
Answer

yes
