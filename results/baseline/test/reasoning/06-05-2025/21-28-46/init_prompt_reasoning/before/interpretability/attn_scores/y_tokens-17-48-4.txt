Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
from
previous
questions
that
the
blue
square
is
below
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
triangle
is
above
the
blue
square
and
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
it
implies
that
the
blue
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
.
Therefore
,
the
red
sphere
cannot
be
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
.
