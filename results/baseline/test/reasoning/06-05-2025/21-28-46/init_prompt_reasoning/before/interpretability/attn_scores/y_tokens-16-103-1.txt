Reason
ing
:
Since
Julius
is
a
frog
,
and
frogs
are
typically
green
,
and
Brian
is
also
a
frog
and
green
,
it
's
likely
that
Julius
is
also
green
.
However
,
there
's
no
direct
mention
of
Julius
'
color
.
Bern
hard
,
who
is
also
a
lion
,
is
gray
,
but
that
doesn
't
necessarily
imply
Julius
'
color
.
The
only
information
we
have
about
Julius
is
that
he
's
a
frog
,
which
doesn
't
provide
a
direct
answer
to
his
color
.
