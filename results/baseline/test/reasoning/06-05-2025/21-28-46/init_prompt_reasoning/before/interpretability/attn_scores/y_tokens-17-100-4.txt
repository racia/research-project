Reason
ing
:
We
are
given
two
sentences
:

1
)
The
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
and

2
)
The
red
square
is
below
the
blue
square
.
We
are
asked
if
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
blue
square
.
Since
the
red
square
is
below
the
blue
square
(
sentence

2
),
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
(
sentence

1
),
we
cannot
directly
infer
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
