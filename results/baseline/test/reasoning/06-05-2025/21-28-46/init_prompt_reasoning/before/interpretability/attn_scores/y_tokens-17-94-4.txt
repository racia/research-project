Reason
ing
:
Since
there
is
no
direct
information
about
the
position
of
the
triangle
with
respect
to
the
yellow
square
,
we
can
't
make
a
conclusion
about
it
being
to
the
left
or
not
.
The
information
provided
only
tells
us
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
(
sentence

2
)
and
below
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

1
),
but
it
doesn
't
provide
any
information
about
the
triangle
's
position
with
respect
to
the
yellow
square
.
