Reason
ing
:
Since
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
yellow
square
,
and
there
is
no
information
about
the
triangle
's
position
relative
to
the
yellow
square
,
we
can
infer
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
triangle
.
The
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
,
but
this
does
not
affect
the
position
of
the
red
sphere
relative
to
the
triangle
.
