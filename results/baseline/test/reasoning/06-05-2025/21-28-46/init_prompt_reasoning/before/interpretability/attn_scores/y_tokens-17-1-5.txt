Reason
ing
:
The
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
This
means
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
on
the
left
side
of
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
on
the
left
side
of
the
red
square
.
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
on
the
left
side
of
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
on
the
left
side
of
the
red
square
,
the
pink
rectangle
cannot
be
on
the
right
side
of
the
red
square
.
