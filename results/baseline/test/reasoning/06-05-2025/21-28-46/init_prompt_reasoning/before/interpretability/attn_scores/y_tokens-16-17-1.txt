Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Brian
,
who
is
a
lion
according
to
sentence

5
.
Since
lions
are
not
mentioned
as
having
a
specific
color
in
the
given
context
,
we
need
to
infer
the
answer
based
on
the
colors
of
other
lions
.
Sentence

6
states
that
Greg
,
who
is
also
a
lion
,
is
green
.
However
,
this
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
Brian
,
another
lion
,
is
also
green
.
There
is
no
direct
information
about
Brian
's
color
,
so
we
cannot
conclude
