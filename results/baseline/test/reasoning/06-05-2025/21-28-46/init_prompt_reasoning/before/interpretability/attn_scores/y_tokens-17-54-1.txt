Reason
ing
:
The
blue
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
,
and
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
This
information
does
not
directly
relate
the
yellow
square
to
the
blue
square
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
yellow
square
is
not
above
the
blue
square
because
if
it
were
,
it
would
be
above
the
pink
rectangle
as
well
,
which
is
not
the
case
.
