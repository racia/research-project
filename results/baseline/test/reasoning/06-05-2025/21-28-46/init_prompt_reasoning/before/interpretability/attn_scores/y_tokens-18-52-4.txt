From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
box
.
Since
the
chest
fits
inside
the
container
,
and
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
box
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
box
.
However
,
we
are
asked
if
the
container
fits
in
the
box
,
which
means
we
need
to
check
if
the
box
can
fit
inside
the
container
.
Since
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
box
,
