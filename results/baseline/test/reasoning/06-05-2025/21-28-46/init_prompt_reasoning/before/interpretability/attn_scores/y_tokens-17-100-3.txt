Reason
ing
:
We
are
given
two
sentences
:

1
)
The
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
and

2
)
The
red
square
is
below
the
blue
square
.
We
are
asked
if
the
blue
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
.
Since
the
red
square
is
below
the
blue
square
(
sentence

2
),
we
can
infer
that
the
blue
square
is
above
the
red
square
.
However
,
this
information
does
not
provide
any
direct
relation
between
the
blue
square
and
the
pink
rectangle
.
Therefore
,
