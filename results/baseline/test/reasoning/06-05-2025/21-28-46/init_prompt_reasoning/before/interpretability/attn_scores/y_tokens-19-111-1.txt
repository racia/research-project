Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
hallway
,
it
implies
that
the
hallway
is
not
east
.
Similarly
,
since
the
garden
is
west
of
the
hallway
,
it
implies
that
the
hallway
is
not
west
.
This
leaves
us
with
the
possibility
that
the
hallway
is
north
or
south
of
the
bathroom
.
Since
the
office
is
north
of
the
bathroom
,
it
implies
that
the
hallway
cannot
be
north
of
the
bathroom
.
Therefore
,
the
hallway
must
be
south
of
the
bathroom
.
Answer
:
south
