Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
if
the
suitcase
fits
in
the
chocolate
.
However
,
from
sentence

3
,
we
know
the
chocolate
fits
inside
the
suitcase
,
which
means
the
chocolate
is
smaller
than
the
suitcase
.
It
is
impossible
for
the
suitcase
to
fit
inside
the
chocolate
,
so
the
answer
is
no
.
Answer
:
no
