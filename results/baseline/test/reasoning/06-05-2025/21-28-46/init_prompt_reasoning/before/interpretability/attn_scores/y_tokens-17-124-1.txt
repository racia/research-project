Reason
ing
:
The
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
and
the
blue
square
is
above
the
red
square
.
Since
the
blue
square
is
above
the
red
square
,
it
means
the
blue
square
is
not
directly
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
Therefore
,
the
yellow
square
,
which
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
is
also
not
directly
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
