Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
and
the
red
square
is
below
the
triangle
.
This
information
does
not
provide
any
direct
relation
between
the
triangle
and
the
pink
rectangle
's
position

Therefore
,
we
cannot
conclude
whether
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
or
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
