Reason
ing
:
The
container
fits
inside
the
chest
(
sentence

4
),
and
the
suitcase
fits
inside
the
container
(
sentence

2
).
This
means
the
suitcase
is
smaller
than
the
container
.
Since
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
suitcase
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
container

(
not

but
can
be

),
the
box
is
also
bigger
than
the
suitcase
.
Therefore
,
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
suitcase
because
it
fits
the
container
,
which
is
bigger
than
the
suitcase
.
