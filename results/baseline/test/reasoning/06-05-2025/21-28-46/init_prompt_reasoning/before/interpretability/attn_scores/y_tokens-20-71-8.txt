Reason
ing
:
Since
Sum
it
is
thirsty
,
he
will
likely
go
to
a
place
where
he
can
qu
ench
his
thirst
.
The
context
sentence
does
not
provide
any
information
about
Sum
it
's
current
location
or
his
plans
,
but
it
does
mention
his
thirst
.
Therefore
,
I
will
infer
that
Sum
it
will
go
to
a
place
where
he
can
get
a
drink
.
