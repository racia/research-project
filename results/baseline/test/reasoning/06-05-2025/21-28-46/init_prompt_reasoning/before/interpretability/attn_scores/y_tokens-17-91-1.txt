Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
red
square
and
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
it
implies
that
the
red
sphere
has
a
position
in
the
context
.
The
red
square
is
below
the
yellow
square
,
which
means
the
red
square
is
below
the
red
sphere
as
well
.
This
information
doesn
't
provide
a
direct
answer
about
the
red
square
's
position
relative
to
the
red
sphere
.
