Reason
ing
:
Bern
hard
is
a
frog
,
and
Julius
is
a
frog
,
but
Julius
is
green
.
Since
Bern
hard
is
also
a
frog
,
it
's
likely
that
Bern
hard
's
color
is
not
mentioned
in
the
context
sentences
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Bern
hard
's
color
is
not
gray
or
green
,
as
Lily
is
gray
and
Julius
is
green
.
