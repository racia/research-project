Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

1
)
and
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
(
sentence

2
).
This
means
that
the
yellow
square
and
the
red
sphere
are
not
adjacent
to
each
other
,
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
between
them
.
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
the
yellow
square
must
be
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
