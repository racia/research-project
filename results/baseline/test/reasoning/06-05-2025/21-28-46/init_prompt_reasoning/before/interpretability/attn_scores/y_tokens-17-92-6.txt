Reason
ing
:
The
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

2
).
The
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

1
).
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
red
square
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
below
the
triangle
.
The
triangle
's
position
relative
to
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
specified
,
but
we
can
conclude
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
below
the
triangle
.
