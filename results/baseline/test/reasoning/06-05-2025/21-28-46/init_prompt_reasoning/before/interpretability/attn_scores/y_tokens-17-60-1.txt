Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
blue
square
and
the
red
square
.
We
know
that
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
(
sentence

1
).
Since
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
blue
square
(
sentence

2
),
we
can
infer
that
the
blue
square
is
not
necessarily
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
.
The
yellow
square
's
position
relative
to
the
red
square
does
not
provide
information
about
the
blue
square
's
position
relative
to
the
red
square
.

No
