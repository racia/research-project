Reason
ing
:
Since
the
kitchen
is
east
of
the
garden
,
and
the
bathroom
is
north
of
the
bedroom
,
we
can
infer
that
the
bathroom
is
not
directly
east
of
the
kitchen
.
However
,
we
know
that
the
hallway
is
west
of
the
bathroom
,
and
the
kitchen
is
south
of
the
hallway
.
This
means
that
to
get
from
the
kitchen
to
the
bathroom
,
we
need
to
go
west
along
the
hallway
and
then
north
.
Answer
:
west
,
north
