Reason
ing
:
The
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
which
means
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
The
triangle
is
also
above
the
red
sphere
,
which
means
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
triangle
.
Since
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
the
red
sphere
(
which
is
below
the
triangle
)
cannot
be
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
.
Therefore
,
the
blue
square
can
be
either
to
the
left
or
below
the
red
sphere
.
