Reason
ing
:
Since
Antoine
is
tired
,
he
will
likely
go
to
a
place
where
he
can
rest
or
sleep
.
The
context
sentence
does
not
provide
any
information
about
Antoine
's
current
location
or
his
plans
,
but
it
does
mention
his
tired
ness
.
Therefore
,
I
will
infer
that
Antoine
will
go
to
a
place
where
he
can
rest
.
