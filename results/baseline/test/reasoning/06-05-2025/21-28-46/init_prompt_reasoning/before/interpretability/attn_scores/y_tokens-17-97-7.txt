Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
that
the
triangle
is
below
the
red
sphere
(
from
sentence

1
),
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
(
from
sentence

2
).
Since
the
triangle
is
below
the
red
sphere
,
it
's
possible
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
red
square
.
However
,
we
can
't
conclude
that
with
certainty
,
as
there
's
no
direct
information
about
the
relative
positions
of
the
red
sphere
and
the
red
square
.
