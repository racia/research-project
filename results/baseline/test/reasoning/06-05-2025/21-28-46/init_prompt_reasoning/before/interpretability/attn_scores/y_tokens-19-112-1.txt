Reason
ing
:
Since
the
kitchen
is
west
of
the
office
(
sentence

3
),
and
the
bathroom
is
west
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

4
),
we
can
infer
that
the
bathroom
is
also
west
of
the
kitchen
.
Additionally
,
the
hallway
is
west
of
the
bathroom
(
sentence

5
),
which
means
the
hallway
is
also
west
of
the
kitchen
.
Therefore
,
to
go
from
the
kitchen
to
the
bathroom
,
we
need
to
go
west
.
Answer
