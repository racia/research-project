Reason
ing
:
We
don
't
have
any
information
that
directly
relates
the
red
square
to
the
blue
square
in
terms
of
vertical
position
(
above
,
below
,
etc
.).
The
only
information
we
have
is
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

1
)
and
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
(
from
sentence

2
).
Since
there
is
no
direct
information
about
the
red
square
's
vertical
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
,
we
can
't
determine
if
the
red
square
is
below
the
blue
square
