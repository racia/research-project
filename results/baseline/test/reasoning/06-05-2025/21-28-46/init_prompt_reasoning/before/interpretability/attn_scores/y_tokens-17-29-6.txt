ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
blue
square
and
the
red
sphere
.
From
sentence

2
,
we
know
that
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
.
Since
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
red
sphere
(
from
sentence

1
),
the
blue
square
is
also
below
the
red
sphere
.
However
,
the
question
asks
about
the
blue
square
's
position
relative
to
the
red
sphere
in
terms
of
left
and
right
,
not
up
and
down
.
Since
there
is
no
information
about
the
