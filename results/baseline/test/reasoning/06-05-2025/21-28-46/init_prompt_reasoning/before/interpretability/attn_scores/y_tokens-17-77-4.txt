Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
yellow
square
and
the
triangle
.
We
already
know
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
Since
the
yellow
square
is
above
the
red
square
,
it
is
not
possible
for
the
yellow
square
to
be
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
as
the
red
square
is
already
occupying
that
position
.

No
