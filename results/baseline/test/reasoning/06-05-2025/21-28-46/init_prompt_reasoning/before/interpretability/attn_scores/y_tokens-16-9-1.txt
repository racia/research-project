Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Greg
,
who
is
a
lion
according
to
sentence

2
.
Since
the
color
of
a
lion
is
not
mentioned
in
the
given

,
we
need
to
infer
it
logically
.
We
can
do
this
by
comparing
the
colors
of
other
animals
that
are
similar
to
lions
,
such
as
Brian
,
who
is
also
a
lion
and
is
gray
according
to
sentence

8
.
This
suggests
that
lions
are
likely
to
be
gray
.
