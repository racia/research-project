Reason
ing
:
Since
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
bathroom
(
sentence

2
),
it
is
not
directly
connected
to
the
bedroom
.
However
,
the
hallway
is
west
of
the
kitchen
(
sentence

3
),
and
the
kitchen
is
south
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

4
).
This
implies
that
to
go
from
the
hallway
to
the
bedroom
,
one
would
need
to
go
east
from
the
hallway
to
the
kitchen
,
and
then
south
from
the
kitchen
to
the
bedroom
.
