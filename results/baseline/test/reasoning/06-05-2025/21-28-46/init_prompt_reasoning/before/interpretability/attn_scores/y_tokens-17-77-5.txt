Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
triangle
and
the
yellow
square
.
We
know
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
but
this
information
does
not
provide
any
direct
relation
between
the
triangle
and
the
yellow
square
.
The
only
information
we
have
about
the
yellow
square
is
that
it
is
below
the
red
square
.
Since
the
triangle
is
not
mentioned
in
relation
to
the
yellow
square
,
we
cannot
determine
its
position
relative
to
the
yellow
square
.
