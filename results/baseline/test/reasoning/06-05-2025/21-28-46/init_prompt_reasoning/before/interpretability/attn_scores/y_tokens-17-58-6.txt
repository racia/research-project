Reason
ing
:
We
know
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
(
from
sentence

1
),
and
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
blue
square
(
from
sentence

2
).
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
and
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
blue
square
,
it
is
possible
that
the
triangle
is
also
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
.
