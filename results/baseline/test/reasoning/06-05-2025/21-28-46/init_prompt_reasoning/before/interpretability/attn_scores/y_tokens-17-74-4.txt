Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
yellow
square
is
above
the
triangle
.
Since
the
triangle
is
below
the
red
sphere
(
as
inferred
earlier
),
we
can
conclude
that
the
triangle
is
not
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
The
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
triangle
is
below
the
red
sphere
,
so
the
triangle
is
likely
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
.
