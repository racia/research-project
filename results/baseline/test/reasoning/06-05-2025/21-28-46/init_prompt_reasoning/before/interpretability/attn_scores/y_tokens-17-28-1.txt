Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
red
square
.
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
(
which
is
below
the
red
square
),
we
need
to
consider
the
spatial
relationships
between
these
objects
.
The
red
sphere
is
below
the
red
square
,
which
means
the
pink
rectangle
(
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
)
is
also
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
