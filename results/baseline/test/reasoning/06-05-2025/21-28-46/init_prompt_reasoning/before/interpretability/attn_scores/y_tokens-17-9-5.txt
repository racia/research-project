Reason
ing
:
We
don
't
have
any
direct
information
about
the
relation
between
the
red
square
and
the
yellow

The
only
information
we
have
is
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

)
and
that
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
(
sentence

These
sentences
don
't
provide
any
information
about
the
relative
positions
of
the
red
square
and
the
yellow
square
.
