Reason
ing
:
The
suitcase
fits
inside
the
container
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
suitcase
is
bigger
than
the
box
(
sentence

2
).
This
means
the
container
is
larger
than
the
box
.
Since
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
(
sentence

4
),
and
the
box
of
chocolates
is
smaller
than
the
box
(
sentence

4
),
the
box
is
larger
than
itself
,
which
is
a
contradiction
.
Therefore
,
the
statement
"
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
container
"
is
false
.
