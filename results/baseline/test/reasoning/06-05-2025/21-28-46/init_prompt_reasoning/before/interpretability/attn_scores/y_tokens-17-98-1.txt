Reason
ing
:
The
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
and
the
blue
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
.
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
it
is
not
directly
related
to
the
pink
rectangle
.
However
,
the
blue
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
,
which
means
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
blue
square
.
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
it
is
also
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
