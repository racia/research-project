Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
suitcase
's
size
or
the
chest
's
fit
inside
the
suitcase
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
,
and
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
suitcase
.
Since
the
container
fits
inside
the
chest
,
it
implies
that
the
chest
is
larger
than
the
container
.
However
,
this
information
does
not
directly
relate
to
the
chest
's
fit
inside
the
suitcase
.
