Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
horizontal
relation
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
red
square
.
Since
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
(
sentence

1
),
it
implies
that
the
red
square
has
a
specific
location
.
However
,
there
is
no
information
provided
about
the
red
sphere
's
horizontal
position
relative
to
the
red
square
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
if
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
or
right
of
the
red
square
.
