Reason
ing
:
Since
Antoine
picked
up
the
apple
in
the
kitchen
,
it
is
likely
that
Antoine
got
the
apple
because
of
the
previous
context
sentence
stating
that
Antoine
went
back
to
the
kitchen
.
However
,
there
is
no
previous
context
sentence
mentioning
Antoine
's
reason
for
going
to
the
kitchen
.
Therefore
,
I
will
assume
that
the
information
is
not
specified
directly
.
