Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
that
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

1
).
Since
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

2
),
there
is
no
information
that
suggests
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
The
triangle
's
position
is
fixed
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
and
the
red
sphere
's
position
is
fixed
below
the
red
square
.
