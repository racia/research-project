Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
red
square
.
Since
the
triangle
is
below
the
red
sphere
,
it
doesn
't
provide
any
information
about
the
position
of
the
red
sphere
relative
to
the
red
square
.
The
only
information
we
have
is
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
This
doesn
't
directly
imply
the
position
of
the
red
sphere
relative
to
the
red
square
.
