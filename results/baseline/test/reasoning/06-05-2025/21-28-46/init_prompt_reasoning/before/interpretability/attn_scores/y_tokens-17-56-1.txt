Reason
ing
:
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
it
implies
that
the
blue
square
is
on
the
left
side
.
Also
,
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
which
implies
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
on
the
right
side
.
There
is
no
information
about
the
vertical
position
of
the
blue
square
and
the
pink
rectangle
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
conclude
whether
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
or
below
the
blue
square
.
