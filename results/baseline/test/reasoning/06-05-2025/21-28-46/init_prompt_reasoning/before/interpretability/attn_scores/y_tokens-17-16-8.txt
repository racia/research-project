Reason
ing
:
The
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
red
square
.
Since
the
triangle
's
position
is
only
specified
as
being
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
red
square
,
we
cannot
conclude
that
the
red
square
is
above
or
below
the
triangle
.
The
triangle
's
position
is
not
specified
in
relation
to
the
red
square
's
vertical
position
.
