:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
red
square
and
the
blue
square
.
We
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
(
from
sentence

1
).
However
,
this
information
only
tells
us
about
the
red
sphere
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
,
not
the
red
square
's
position
.
We
also
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

2
),
which
doesn
't
provide
any
information
about
the
red
square
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
