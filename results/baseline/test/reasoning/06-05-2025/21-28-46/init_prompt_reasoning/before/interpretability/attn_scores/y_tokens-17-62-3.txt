:
We
know
that
the
triangle
is
below
the
blue
square
(
sentence

2
),
but
this
information
doesn
't
directly
relate
to
the
red
square
.
We
also
know
that
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
(
sentence

1
),
but
this
doesn
't
tell
us
about
the

position
of
the
red
square
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
Since
there
is
no
direct
information
about
the
red
square
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
,
we
cannot
conclude
whether
the
red
square
is
below
the
blue
