,
we
know
the
red
square
is
above
the
blue
square
.
However

the
question
asks
about
the
relative
position
of
the
yellow
square
and
the
blue
square
,
not
the
red
square
.
Since
the
question
doesn
't
provide
any
direct
information
about
the
yellow
square
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
,
we
cannot
make
a
definitive
conclusion
.
