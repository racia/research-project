Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
red
square
is
below
the
triangle
,
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
This
information
does
not
provide
any
direct
relation
between
the
triangle
and
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
.
However
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
above
the
triangle
,
as
there
is
no
direct
information
suggesting
it
is
.
We
also
cannot
conclude
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
or
beside
the
triangle
,
as
there
is
no
direct
information
suggesting
it
is
.
