Reason
ing
:
The
suitcase
is
bigger
than
the
container
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
box
fits
inside
the
suitcase
(
sentence

2
).
This
means
the
box
is
smaller
than
the
suitcase
.
Additionally
,
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
box
(
sentence

4
),
which
implies
the
suitcase
is
also
bigger
than
the
box
.
Since
the
suitcase
is
bigger
than
the
container
,
and
the
box
is
smaller
than
the
suitcase
,
the
box
cannot
be
bigger
than
the
suitcase
.
