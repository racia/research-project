Reason
ing
:
Since
the
office
is
not
directly
mentioned
as
being
adjacent
to
the
garden
,
we
need
to
find
a
path
from
the
office
to
the
garden
.
We
know
that
the
hallway
is
south
of
the
office
,
and
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
garden
.
We
also
know
that
the
bedroom
is
south
of
the
bathroom
,
which
means
the
bedroom
is
not
directly
adjacent
to
the
garden
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
office
,
which
means
it
is
possible
to
go
from
the
office
