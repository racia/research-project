Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
hallway
,
it
implies
that
the
bedroom
is
not
adjacent
to
the
bathroom
,
which
is
west
of
the
kitchen
.
Also
,
the
bedroom
is
south
of
the
kitchen
,
which
means
the
bathroom
is
north
of
the
kitchen
.
To
go
from
the
bedroom
to
the
bathroom
,
we
need
to
move
west
from
the
bedroom
,
which
is
not
possible
directly
.
We
need
to
move
north
from
the
bedroom
to
reach
the
kitchen
,
and
then
west
from
the
kitchen
to
reach
the
bathroom
