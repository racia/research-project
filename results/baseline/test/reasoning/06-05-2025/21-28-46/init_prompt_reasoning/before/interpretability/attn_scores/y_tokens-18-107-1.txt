Reason
ing
:
Since
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
box
(
sentence

2
),
and
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
(
sentence

5
),
it
implies
that
the
container
is
also
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.
Since
the
chocolate
fits
inside
the
box
(
sentence

1
),
it
is
logical
to
infer
that
the
chocolate
will
also
fit
inside
the
container
,
which
is
bigger
than
the
box
.
