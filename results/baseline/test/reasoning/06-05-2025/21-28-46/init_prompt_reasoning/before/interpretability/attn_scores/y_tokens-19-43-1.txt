Reason
ing
:
Since
the
kitchen
is
north
of
the
garden
(
sentence

5
),
and
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
office
(
sentence

2
),
we
need
to
find
a
path
from
the
kitchen
to
the
bedroom
.
Since
the
bedroom
is
also
south
of
the
garden
(
sentence

4
),
we
can
conclude
that
the
bedroom
is
not
directly
east
of
the
kitchen
.
However
,
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
kitchen
(
sentence

3
),
and
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
office
(
