:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Julius
,
who
is
a
rh
ino
according
to
sentence

6
.
Since
rh
inos
are
not
typically
associated
with
a
specific
color
,
we
need
to
look
for
any
information
that
might
give
us
a
hint
.
Sentence

5
mentions
that
Greg
,
who
is
also
a
rh
ino
,
is
green
.
However
,
this
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
Julius
,
who
is
also
a
rh
ino
,
is
green
.
There
is
no
information
that
suggests
Julius
has
a
specific
color
.
