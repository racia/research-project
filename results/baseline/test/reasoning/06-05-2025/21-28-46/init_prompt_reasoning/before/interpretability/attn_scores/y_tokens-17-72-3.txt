Reason
ing
:
Since
the
blue
square
is
below
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
,
we
can
infer
that
the
blue
square
is
not
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
The
triangle
's
right
side
is
occupied
by
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
blue
square
is
below
it
,
so
it
cannot
be
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
