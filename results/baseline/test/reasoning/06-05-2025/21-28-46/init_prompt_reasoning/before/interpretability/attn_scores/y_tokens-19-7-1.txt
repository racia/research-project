Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bedroom
is
north
of
the
hallway
(
sentence

4
),
and
the
kitchen
is
north
of
the
garden
(
sentence

5
),
we
can
infer
that
the
bedroom
is
also
north
of
the
garden
.
Additionally
,
the
garden
is
west
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

2
),
which
means
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
garden
.
Comb
ining
these
directions
,
we
can
conclude
that
to
go
from
the
bedroom
to
the
kitchen
,
we
need
to
go
east
and
then
north
.
Answer

east
