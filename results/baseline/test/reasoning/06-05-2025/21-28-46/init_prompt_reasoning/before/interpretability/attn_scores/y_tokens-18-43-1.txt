Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
provide
information
about
the
relationships
between
the
box
,
the
chest
,
the
container
,
the
suitcase
,
and
the
chocolate
.
From
these
sentences
,
we
can
infer
that
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
(
sentence

4
),
and
the
box
is
big
enough
to
fit
the
suitcase
(
sentence

5
).
However
,
there
is
no
direct
information
about
the
size
of
the
box
compared
to
the
chest
or
the
container
.
