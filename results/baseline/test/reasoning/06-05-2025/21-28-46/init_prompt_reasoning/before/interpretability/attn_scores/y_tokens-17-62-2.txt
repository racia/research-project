Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
blue
square
and
the
red
square
.
We
know
that
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
(
sentence

1
),
but
this
information
doesn
't
directly
tell
us
about
the
blue
square
's
position
relative
to
the
red
square
.
We
also
know
that
the
triangle
is
below
the
blue
square
(
sentence

2
),
but
this
doesn
't
tell
us
about
the
blue
square
's
horizontal
position
relative
to
the
red
square
.
