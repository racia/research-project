Reason
ing
:
The
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
and
the
blue
square
is
above
the
red
square
.
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
it
is
not
directly
related
to
the
position
of
the
red
square
above
or
below
it
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
conclude
whether
the
red
square
is
above
or
below
the
triangle
.
