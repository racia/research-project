Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bathroom
is
south
of
the
garden
(
sentence

3
),
and
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
bathroom
(
not
explicitly
mentioned
,
but
can
be
inferred
as
the
hallway
is
not
mentioned
as
being
west
of
the
bathroom
),
we
can
conclude
that
the
bathroom
is
not
directly
adjacent
to
the
hallway
.
Therefore
,
to
go
from
the
bathroom
to
the
hallway
,
we
need
to
move
north
(
sentence

5
)
and
then
east
(
sentence

2
).
Answer

north
,
