Reason
ing
:
The
box
fits
inside
the
suitcase
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
box
of
chocolates
is
smaller
than
the
box
(
sentence

3
).
Since
the
box
fits
inside
the
suitcase
,
the
box
of
chocolates
,
which
is
smaller
,
can
also
fit
inside
the
suitcase
.
This
implies
that
the
suitcase
is
not
smaller
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.
However
,
the
box
of
chocolates
is
smaller
than
the
box
,
which
means
the
box
of
chocolates
cannot
fit
inside
the
box
.
Therefore
,
the
suitcase
cannot
fit
inside
