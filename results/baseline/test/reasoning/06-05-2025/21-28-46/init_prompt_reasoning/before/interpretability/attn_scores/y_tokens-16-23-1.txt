Reason
ing
:
Bern
hard
is
a
rh
ino
,
and
Lily
is
a
rh
ino
,
but
Lily
is
yellow
.
Since
Bern
hard
is
also
a
rh
ino
,
it
's
likely
that
Bern
hard
's
color
is
not
yellow
,
as
it
would
be
redundant
.
However
,
there
's
no
information
about
Bern
hard
's
color
being
different
from
Lily
's
.
Therefore
,
it
's
possible
that
Bern
hard
's
color
is
also
yellow
.
