Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Greg
,
who
is
a
lion
according
to
sentence

1
.
Since
the
color
of
a
lion
is
not
specified
,
we
need
to
infer
it
.
However
,
sentence

5
mentions
the
color
of
Julius
,
who
is
a
rh
ino
,
as
gray
.
Since
lions
and
rh
inos
are
different
animals
,
their
colors
are
not
necessarily
related
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
infer
the
color
of
Greg
from
the
information
provided
.
