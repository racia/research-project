Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Lily
,
who
is
described
as
a
lion
in
sentence

8
.
Since
lions
are
not
typically
associated
with
colors
,
we
need
to
look
for
any
information
that
might
relate
to
Lily
's
color
.
However
,
there
is
no
direct
mention
of
Lily
's
color
in
the
given
sentences
.
We
can
try
to
infer
Lily
's
color
by
looking
at
the
colors
associated
with
other
lions
,
but
that
would
be
an
assumption
.
