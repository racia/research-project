Reason
ing
:
The
triangle
is
below
the
blue
square
(
sentence

2
),
but
it
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

1
).
This
implies
that
the
blue
square
is
not
directly
above
or
below
the
yellow
square
.
However
,
we
know
that
the
triangle
is
below
the
blue
square
,
which
means
the
blue
square
is
not
above
the
yellow
square
.
Therefore
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
blue
square
is
not
below
the
yellow
square
.
