Reason
ing
:
Since
the
blue
square
is
above
the
yellow
square
,
it
means
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
blue
square
.
Also
,
the
blue
square
is
below
the
triangle
,
which
implies
that
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
triangle
as
well
.
However
,
the
question
asks
if
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
,
not
below
.
We
need
to
consider
the
relative
positions
of
the
yellow
square
and
the
triangle
.
