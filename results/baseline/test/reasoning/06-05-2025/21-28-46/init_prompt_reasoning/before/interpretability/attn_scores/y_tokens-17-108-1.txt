Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
red
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
we
can
infer
that
the
red
sphere
is
on
the
right
side
.
The
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
which
means
it
is
on
the
left
side
.
Since
the
red
sphere
is
on
the
right
side
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
on
the
left
side
,
the
pink
rectangle
cannot
be
below
the
red
sphere
.
