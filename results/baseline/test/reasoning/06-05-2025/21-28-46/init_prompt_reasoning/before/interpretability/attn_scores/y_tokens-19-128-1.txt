:
Since
the
bedroom
is
west
of
the
bathroom
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

2
),
we
can
infer
that
the
bedroom
is
not
directly
north
of
the
hallway
.
Additionally
,
the
kitchen
is
north
of
the
garden
(
sentence

4
),
and
the
garden
is
north
of
the

(
sentence

5

This
suggests
that
the
hallway
is
not
directly
north
of
the

.
Therefore
,
to

from
the
bedroom
to
the
garden
,
we
need
to
move
