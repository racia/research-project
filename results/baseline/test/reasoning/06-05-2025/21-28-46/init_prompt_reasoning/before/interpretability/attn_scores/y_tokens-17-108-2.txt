Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
pink
rectangle
.
We
know
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
(
from
sentence

2
).
We
also
know
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
(
from
sentence

1
).
Since
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
,
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
the
red
sphere
cannot
be
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
