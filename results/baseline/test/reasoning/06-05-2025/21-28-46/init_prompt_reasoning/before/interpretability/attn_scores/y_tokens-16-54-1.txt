Reason
ing
:
Since
Brian
is
a
rh
ino
(
from
sentence

4
),
and
Julius
is
also
a
rh
ino
(
from
sentence

6
),
we
can
infer
that
Brian
's
color
is
not
mentioned
in
the
given
context
.
However
,
we
can
look
for
any
information
about
Brian
's
color
.
Julius
is
green
(
from
sentence

9
),
but
this
does
not
necessarily
mean
Brian
is
also
green
.
Since
Brian
's
color
is
not
mentioned
,
we
cannot
conclude
a
specific
color
.
Answer

Not
mentioned
