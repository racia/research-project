Reason
ing
:
The
yellow
square
is
above
the
blue
square
(
from
sentence

1
),
and
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
(
from
sentence

2
).
Since
the
blue
square
is
below
the
yellow
square
,
it
cannot
be
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
The
triangle
's
left
side
is
occupied
by
the
yellow
square
,
which
is
above
the
blue
square
.
There
is
no
information
that
suggests
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
.
