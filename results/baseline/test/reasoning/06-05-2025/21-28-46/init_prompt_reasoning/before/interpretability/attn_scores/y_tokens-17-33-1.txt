Reason
ing
:
Since
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
it
implies
that
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
.
Additionally
,
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
triangle
,
which
means
the
blue
square
is
not
directly
related
to
the
triangle
in
terms
of
its
position
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
conclude
that
the
blue
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
.
