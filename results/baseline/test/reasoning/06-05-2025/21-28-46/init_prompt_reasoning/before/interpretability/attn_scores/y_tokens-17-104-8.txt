Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
that
the
blue
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
(
sentence

1
)
and
the
blue
square
is
below
the
red
square
(
sentence

2
).
Since
the
blue
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
,
and
the
blue
square
is
below
the
red
square
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
red
square
,
but
we
can
't
conclude
that
it
's
above
the
red
square
.
