Reason
ing
:
Since
the
garden
is
south
of
the
kitchen
(
sentence

3
),
and
the
garden
is
north
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

5
),
we
can
conclude
that
the
kitchen
and
bedroom
are
not
directly
adjacent
.
Additionally
,
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
garden
(
sentence

1
),
which
implies
that
the
hallway
is
not
between
the
kitchen
and
bedroom
.
The
only
remaining
option
is
to
go
from
the
kitchen
to
the
bedroom
through
the
garden
,
which
would
require
moving
south
from
the
kitchen
to
the
garden
,
