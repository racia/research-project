Reason
ing
:
The
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
,
and
the
blue
square
is
below
the
yellow
square
.
This
information
does
not
directly
relate
the
blue
square
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
Since
the
blue
square
is
below
the
yellow
square
,
it
is
not
necessarily
to
the
left
or
right
of
the
triangle
.
We
cannot
make
a
conclusion
about
the
blue
square
's
position
relative
to
the
triangle
's
left
side
.
