Reason
ing
:
Since
the
red
square
is
below
the
red
sphere
,
it
implies
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
red
square
.
However
,
there
is
no
direct
information
about
the
position
of
the
triangle
relative
to
the
red
sphere
.
The
only
information
available
is
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
which
does
not
provide
any
information
about
the
triangle
's
position
relative
to
the
red
sphere
.
