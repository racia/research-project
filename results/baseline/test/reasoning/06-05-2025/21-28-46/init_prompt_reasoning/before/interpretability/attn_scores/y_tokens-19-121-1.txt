Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bedroom
is
west
of
the
bathroom
(
sentence

5
),
and
the
bathroom
is
north
of
the
hallway
(
sentence

2
),
we
can
conclude
that
the
bedroom
is
also
west
of
the
hallway
.
Additionally
,
the
bedroom
is
south
of
the
kitchen
(
sentence

3
),
and
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
garden
(
sentence

4
).
This
information
doesn
't
provide
a
direct
path
from
the
bedroom
to
the
hallway
,
but
it
helps
us
understand
the
relative
positions
of
the
entities
.
