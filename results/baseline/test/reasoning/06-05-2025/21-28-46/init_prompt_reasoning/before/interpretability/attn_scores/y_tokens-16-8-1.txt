The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Lily
,
who
is
a
sw
an
.
Since
sw
ans
are
not
mentioned
as
having
a
specific
color
in
the
context
sentences
,
we
need
to
infer
the
answer
.
We
can
do
this
by
looking
at
the
colors
associated
with
other
sw
ans
and
animals
.
Brian
is
a
sw
an
and
is
green
,
which
suggests
that
sw
ans
can
be
green
.
However
,
we
don
't
have
any
information
about
the
color
of
Lily
specifically
.
Therefore
,
we
can
't
determine
the
