Reason
ing
:
The
suitcase
is
bigger
than
the
box
(
from
sentence

3
),
and
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
(
from
sentence

1
).
This
implies
that
the
suitcase
is
not
smaller
than
the
chocolate
,
but
it
's
not
necessarily
smaller
either
.
Since
the
suitcase
is
not
explicitly
stated
to
fit
inside
the
chocolate
,
we
cannot
conclude
that
it
does
.
