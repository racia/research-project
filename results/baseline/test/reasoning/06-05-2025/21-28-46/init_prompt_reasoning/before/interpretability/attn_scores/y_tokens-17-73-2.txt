Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
triangle
.
From
the
previous
context
,
we
know
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
red
sphere
and
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
However
,
there
is
no
direct
information
about
the
relation
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
triangle
.
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
red
sphere
,
it
does
not
necessarily
imply
the
same
relation
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
triangle
.
