Reason
ing
:
Since
Julius
is
a
lion
(
sentence

9
),
and
there
is
no
information
about
the
color
of
Julius
,
we
can
infer
that
Julius
is
not
gray
(
since
Greg
,
a
frog
,
is
gray
,
and
Bern
hard
,
a
sw
an
,
is
gray
,
but
Julius
is
a
lion
,
which
is
a
different
species
).
Therefore
,
we
can
conclude
that
Julius
's
color
is
not
mentioned
in
the
context
sentences
.
