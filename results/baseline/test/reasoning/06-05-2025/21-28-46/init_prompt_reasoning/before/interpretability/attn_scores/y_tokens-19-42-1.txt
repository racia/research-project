Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bedroom
is
west
of
the
hallway
,
it
implies
that
the
bedroom
is
not
adjacent
to
the
office
.
From
sentence

5
,
we
know
that
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
bathroom
.
From
sentence

2
,
we
know
that
the
office
is
north
of
the
bathroom
.
Comb
ining
these
information
,
we
can
conclude
that
to
go
from
the
bedroom
to
the
office
,
we
need
to
go
east
from
the
bedroom
to
the
bathroom
,
and
then
north
from
the
bathroom
to
the
office
.
