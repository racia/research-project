Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
(
sentence

1
).
Since
the
red
square
is
above
the
red
sphere
(
no
direct
information
,
but
we
can
infer
that
the
red
square
is
not
below
the
red
sphere
),
we
can
conclude
that
the
red
square
is
also
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
