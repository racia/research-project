The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Lily
,
who
is
described
as
a
sw
an
in
sentence

3
.
Since
Lily
is
a
sw
an
,
we
can
infer
that
her
color
is
not
mentioned
in
the
given

sentences
.
However
,
we
can
look

in
general

Since
Bern

is
a

(
sentence

6
),
we
can
infer
that
sw
ans
are
typically
white
,
as
Bern
hard
is
white
(
sentence

9
).
However
,
this
is
an
inference
