Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Julius
,
who
is
a
frog
according
to
sentence

2
.
Since
frogs
are
not
typically
associated
with
a
specific
color
,
we
need
to
look
for
any
information
that
might
provide
a
hint
.
However
,
there
is
no
mention
of
Julius
's
color
in
the
given
sentences
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Julius
's
color
is
not
mentioned
.
Answer
:
Not
mentioned
