Reason
ing
:
We
don
't
have
any
direct
information
about
the
relation
between
the
yellow
square

the
red

The
only
information
we
have
is
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

and
that
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
(
sentence

These
sentences
don
't
provide
any
information
about
the
relative
positions
of
the
yellow
square
and
the
red
square
.
