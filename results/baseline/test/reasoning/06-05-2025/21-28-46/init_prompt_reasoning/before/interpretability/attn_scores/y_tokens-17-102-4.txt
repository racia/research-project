Reason
ing
:
The
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
triangle
.
This
implies
that
the
triangle
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
.
Since
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
the
pink
rectangle
(
which
is
below
the
triangle
)
cannot
be
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
