Reason
ing
:
The
blue
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
,
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
This
implies
that
the
red
sphere
is
not
directly
above
the
blue
square
,
but
rather
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
which
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
.
Therefore
,
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
.
