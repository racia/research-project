Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relative
position
of
the
red
sphere
and
the
triangle
.
Since
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
red
square
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
we
need
to
consider
the
vertical
and
horizontal
positions
separately
.
The
vertical
position
is
already
established
,
and
the
horizontal
position
is
that
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
There
is
no
information
that
suggests
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
.
Answer
:
No
