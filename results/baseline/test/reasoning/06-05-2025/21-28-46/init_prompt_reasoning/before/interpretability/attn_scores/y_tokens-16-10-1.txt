Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Brian
,
who
is
a
sw
an
according
to
sentence

8
.
Since
sw
ans
are
not
mentioned
to
have
a
specific
color
in
the
given
context
,
we
need
to
infer
the
color
based
on
the
information
provided
.
Sentence

7
states
that
Greg
,
who
is
also
a
sw
an
,
is
gray
.
This
might
suggest
that
sw
ans
are
generally
gray
.
However
,
this
is
an
assumption
and
not
a
direct
statement
.
Answer
:
Gray
