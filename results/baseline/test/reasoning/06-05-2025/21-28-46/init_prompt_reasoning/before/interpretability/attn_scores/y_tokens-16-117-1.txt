Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Greg
,
who
is
a
lion
according
to
sentence

9
.
Julius
is
also
a
lion
and
is
white
according
to
sentence

7
.
However
,
there
is
no
direct
information
about
Greg
's
color
.
Since
Julius
,
another
lion
,
is
white
,
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
Greg
,
being
a
lion
as
well
,
might
also
be
white
.
Answer
:
White
