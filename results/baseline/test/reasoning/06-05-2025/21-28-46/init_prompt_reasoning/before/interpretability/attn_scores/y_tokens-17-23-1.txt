Reason
ing
:
The
red
sphere
is
not
mentioned
in
relation
to
the
blue
square
in
any
of
the
given
context
sentences
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
red
square
,
as
stated
in
sentence

1
.
Since
the
red
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
(
sentence

2
),
we
can
conclude
that
the
red
sphere
is
also
above
the
blue
square
,
but
not
necessarily
below
it
.
