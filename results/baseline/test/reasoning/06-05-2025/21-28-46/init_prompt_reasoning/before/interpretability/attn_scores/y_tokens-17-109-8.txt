Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
(
from
sentence

2
),
but
this
information
doesn
't
directly
relate
to
the
blue
square
's
position
relative
to
the
red
square
.
However
,
we
don
't
have
any
information
that
directly
connects
the
blue
square
to
the
red
square
.
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
we
can
't
infer
anything
about
the
blue
square
's
position
relative
to
the
red
square
.
