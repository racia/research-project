Reason
ing
:
According
to
sentence

1
,
the
chocolate
fits
inside
the
suitcase
.
Since
the
box
of
chocolates
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
(
sentence

10
),
it
is
likely
that
the
box
of
chocolates
does
not
fit
inside
the
suitcase
.
However
,
sentence

9
states
that
the
suitcase
is
bigger
than
the
box
,
which
implies
that
the
suitcase
is
also
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.
