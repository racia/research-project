Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
office
,
and
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
bedroom
,
the
hallway
is
also
north
of
the
office
.
The
kitchen
is
west
of
the
hallway
,
and
the
bathroom
is
east
of
the
kitchen
.
This
means
that
the
bedroom
and
the
kitchen
are
not
directly
adjacent
,
but
the
bedroom
and
the
hallway
are
.
To
get
from
the
bedroom
to
the
kitchen
,
you
would
need
to
go
north
to
the
hallway
and
then
west
to
the
kitchen
.
