Reason
ing
:
Since
Y
ann
took
the
paj
amas
,
it
is
likely
that
Y
ann
got
the
paj
amas
because
Y
ann
is
tired
(
as
mentioned
in
context
sentence

5
).
The
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
other
information
about
Y
ann
's
motivations
,
so
I
will
make
an
inference
based
on
the
assumption
that
Y
ann
's
tired
ness
led
to
the
decision
to
get
the
paj
amas
.
Answer

tired
