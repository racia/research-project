Reason
ing
:
We
don
't
have
any
information
that
directly
states
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
relative
to
the
triangle
.
The
only
information
we
have
is
about
the
yellow
square
's
position
relative
to
the
triangle
and
the
pink
rectangle
.
Since
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
we
can
't
infer
anything
about
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
.
