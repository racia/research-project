:
The
blue
square
is
above
the
red
square
,
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
To
determine
if
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
we
need
to
consider
the
relative
positions
of
the
blue
square
and
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
blue
square
is
above
the
red
square
,
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
blue
square
is
not
directly
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
