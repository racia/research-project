ing
:
Since
Y
ann
is
hungry
,
he
needs

Answer

(
Note
:
There
is
no
information
provided
about
Y
ann
's
destination
,
so
I
cannot
provide
a
specific
answer
.
The
previous
context
sentences
did
not
mention
Y
ann
's
destination
,
and
this
new
information
does
not
provide
enough
context
to
determine
where
Y
ann
will
go
.)
