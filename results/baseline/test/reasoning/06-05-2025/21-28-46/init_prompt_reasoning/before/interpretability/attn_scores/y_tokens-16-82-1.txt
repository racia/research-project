Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Lily
,
who
is
mentioned
in
sentence

9
as
a
rh
ino
.
Since
Bern
hard
,
also
a
rh
ino
,
is
green
(
sentence

6
),
it
's
possible
that
Lily
,
being
a
rh
ino
,
might
also
be
green
.
However
,
there
's
no
direct
mention
of
Lily
's
color
.
The
only
clue
is
the
similarity
with
Bern
hard
's
color
.
Answer
:
green
