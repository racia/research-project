Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Lily
,
who
is
a
lion
according
to
sentence

2
.
Since
lions
are
not
typically
associated
with
a
specific
color
,
we
need
to
infer
the
answer
based
on
the
information
provided
.
We
can
see
that
Brian
,
who
is
also
a
lion
,
is
yellow
(
sentence

6
).
However
,
this
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
Lily
,
who
is
also
a
lion
,
is
yellow
.
We
need
to
look
for
more
information
.
