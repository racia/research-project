Reason
ing
:
The
yellow
square
is
above
the
blue
square
(
from
sentence

1
),
and
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
(
from
sentence

2
).
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
yellow
square
is
above
the
blue
square
,
the
triangle
is
not
directly
above
the
blue
square
.
However
,
there
is
no
information
that
suggests
the
triangle
is
below
the
blue
square
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
conclude
that
the
triangle
is
above
or
below
the
blue
square
.
