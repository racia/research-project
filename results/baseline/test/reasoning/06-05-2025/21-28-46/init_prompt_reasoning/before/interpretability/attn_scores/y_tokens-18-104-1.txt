Reason
ing
:
The
chest
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
(
sentence

2
),
and
the
box
of
chocolates
fits
inside
the
chest
(
sentence

5
).
This
implies
that
the
chest
is
larger
than
the
box
.
However
,
the
question
asks
if
the
chest
fits
inside
the
box
,
not
the
box
of
chocolates
.
Since
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
box
,
it
does
not
fit
inside
the
box
.
Answer

no
