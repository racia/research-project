Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
if
the
chest
fits
inside
the
box
of
chocolates
.
From
sentence

6
,
we
know
that
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.
Since
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
container
(
sentence

4
),
it
is
also
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.
However
,
sentence

10
states
that
the
chest
fits
inside
the
box
.
Therefore
,
the
chest
does
not
fit
inside
the
box
of
chocolates
.
