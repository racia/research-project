Reason
ing
:
Since
the
red
square
is
below
the
blue
square
(
sentence

2
),
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
(
sentence

1
),
we
can
infer
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
necessarily
below
the
blue
square
.
The
red
square
's
position
relative
to
the
pink
rectangle
does
not
provide
information
about
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
.

No
