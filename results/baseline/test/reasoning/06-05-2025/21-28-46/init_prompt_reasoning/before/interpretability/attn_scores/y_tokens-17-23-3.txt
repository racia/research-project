Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
information
about
the
blue
square
's
position
relative
to
the
red
sphere
.
The
only
information
given
is
about
the
red
square
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
(
it
's
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
)
and
the
red
sphere
's
position
relative
to
the
red
square
(
it
's
above
the
red
square
).
Since
there
is
no
direct
information
about
the
blue
square
's
position
relative
to
the
red
sphere
,
we
cannot
determine
if
it
's
below
the
red
sphere
.
