Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bedroom
is
south
of
the
kitchen
(
sentence

2
),
and
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
office
(
sentence

4
),
we
can
infer
that
the
hallway
is
not
directly
adjacent
to
the
bedroom
.
However
,
sentence

5
states
that
the
hallway
is
south
of
the
bathroom
,
which
is
south
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

3
).
This
implies
that
the
hallway
is
south
of
the
bedroom
,
not
east
or
west
.
Answer
:
south
