Reason
ing
:
We
know
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
blue
square
(
from
sentence

2
),
but
we
don
't
have
any
information
about
the
triangle
's
vertical
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
(
from
sentence

1
),
it
is
possible
that
the
triangle
is
above
the
blue
square
,
but
we
cannot
conclude
it
with
certainty
.
