Reason
ing
:
The
chest
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
(
sentence

2
),
but
the
box
of
chocolates
fits
inside
the
chest
(
sentence

5
).
This
implies
that
the
box
is
smaller
than
the
chest
.
Additionally
,
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
(
sentence

3
),
and
the
chocolate
fits
inside
the
box
(
sentence

6
).
This
suggests
that
the
box
is
larger
than
the
chocolate
.
Since
the
box
is
larger
than
the
chocolate
,
it
is
also
larger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.
