Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
(
from
sentence

2
),
and
the
triangle
is
below
the
red
sphere
(
from
sentence

1
).
Since
the
triangle
is
a
barrier
between
the
red
square
and
the
red
sphere
,
we
can
't
conclude
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
.
The
information
provided
doesn
't
imply
a
right
-left
relationship
between
the
two
.
