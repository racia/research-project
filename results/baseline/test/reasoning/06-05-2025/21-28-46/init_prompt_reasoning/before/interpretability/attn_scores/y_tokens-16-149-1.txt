Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Lily
,
who
is
a
lion
according
to
sentence

9
.
Since
the
color
of
a
lion
is
not
specified
in
the
given
context
,
we
need
to
infer
it
based
on
the
information
provided
.
Sentence

4
states
that
Greg
,
who
is
a
lion
,
is
white
.
However
,
this
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
all
lions
are
white
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
conclude
the
color
of
Lily
based
on
the
color
of
Greg
.
