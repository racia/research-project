Reason
ing
:
The
blue
square
is
below
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
.
This
means
that
the
blue
square
is
below
something
(
the
triangle
),
but
it
doesn
't
directly
tell
us
about
its
relation
to
the
red
sphere
.
However
,
since
the
blue
square
is
below
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
we
can
infer
that
the
blue
square
is
also
below
the
red
sphere
.
