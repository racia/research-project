:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Brian
,
who
is
a
frog
according
to
sentence

2
.
Since
the
color
of
Brian
is
not
mentioned
in
the
given
sentences
,
we
need
to
infer
it
based
on
the
information
provided
.
We
know
that
frogs
are
not
typically
associated
with
a
specific
color
,
so
we
can
't
make
a
direct
inference
.
However
,
we
can
look
at
the
colors
of
other
animals
mentioned
in
the
sentences
.
For
example
,
Lily
is
green
(
sentence

3
),
and
Bern
