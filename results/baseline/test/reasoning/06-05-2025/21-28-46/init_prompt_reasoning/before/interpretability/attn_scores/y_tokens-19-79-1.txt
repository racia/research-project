Reason
ing
:
Since
the
kitchen
is
east
of
the
garden
(
sentence

5
),
and
the
bathroom
is
west
of
the
garden
(
sentence

2
),
we
can
infer
that
the
bathroom
is
also
west
of
the
kitchen
.
Additionally
,
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
bathroom
(
sentence

1
).
Therefore
,
to
go
from
the
kitchen
to
the
bathroom
,
we
need
to
move
west
from
the
kitchen
and
then
north
along
the
hallway
.
