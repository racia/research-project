Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
(
sentence

2
),
but
we
don
't
know
its
position
with
respect
to
the
yellow
square
.
We
also
know
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

1
),
which
doesn
't
provide
any
information
about
the
yellow
square
's
position
with
respect
to
the
triangle
.
Since
there
is
no
direct
information
about
the
yellow
square
's
position
with
respect
to
the
triangle
,
we
can
't
conclude
whether
it
's
to
the
left
