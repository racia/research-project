Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
(
from
sentence

1
).
The
blue
square
is
also
below
the
pink
rectangle
(
from
sentence

2
).
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
blue
square
,
it
implies
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
above
the
red
sphere
.
The
blue
square
is
below
the
pink
rectangle
,
and
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
which
means
the
red
sphere
is
not
above
the
pink
rectangle
.
