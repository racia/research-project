Reason
ing
:
Since
the
hallway
is
not
directly
adjacent
to
the
garden
,
we
need
to
find
a
path
that
connects
them
.
From
sentence

3
,
we
know
that
the
kitchen
is
east
of
the
hallway
.
From
sentence

2
,
we
know
that
the
bedroom
is
west
of
the
garden
.
From
sentence

4
,
we
know
that
the
bedroom
is
north
of
the
hallway
.
Comb
ining
these
information
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
hallway
is
south
of
the
bedroom
,
and
the
bedroom
is
west
of
the
garden
.
