Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
(
from
sentence

).
However
,
we
don
't
have
any
information
about
the
yellow
square
's
position
relative
to
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
red
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
we
can
't
conclude
anything
about
the
yellow
square
's
position
.
