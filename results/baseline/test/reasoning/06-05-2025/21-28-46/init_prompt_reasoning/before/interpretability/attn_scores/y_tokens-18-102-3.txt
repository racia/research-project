Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
mention
the
chocolate
as
a
container
or
a
space
where
something
can
fit
.
Instead
,
the
chocolate
is
mentioned
as
something
that
fits
inside
the
box
(
sentence

4
).
This
implies
that
the
chocolate
is
a
small
object
,
not
a
container
.
Therefore
,
it
is
not
possible
for
the
chest
to
fit
inside
the
chocolate
.
