Reason
ing
:
We
are
given
information
about
the
triangle
's
position
relative
to
the
yellow
square
and
the
blue
square
.
The
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

1
)
and
below
the
blue
square
(
sentence

2
).
This
implies
that
the
blue
square
is
above
the
triangle
,
but
it
does
not
provide
any
information
about
the
yellow
square
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
We
cannot
infer
the
blue
square
's
position
relative
to
the
yellow
square
.
