Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
that
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
and
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
This
implies
that
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
,
which
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
.
Therefore
,
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
not
to
the
right
.
