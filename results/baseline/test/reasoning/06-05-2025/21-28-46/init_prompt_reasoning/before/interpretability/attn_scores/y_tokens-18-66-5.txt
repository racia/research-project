Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
direct
information
about
the
size
of
the
chocolate
compared
to
the
container
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
chocolate
is
smaller
than
the
box
of
chocolates
(
from
sentence

5
),
and
the
box
of
chocolates
is
smaller
than
the
box
(
from
sentence

4
).
Since
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
box
(
from
sentence

3
),
it
is
unlikely
that
the
chocolate
would
be
bigger
than
the
container
.
