Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Brian
,
who
is
a
lion
(
sentence

4
).
Since
Julius
,
who
is
also
a
lion
,
is
yellow
(
sentence

6
),
it
's
possible
that
Brian
's
color
is
also
yellow
.
However
,
there
's
no
direct
information
about
Brian
's
color
.
The
only
information
about
color
is
related
to
Greg
,
who
is
gray
(
sentence

3
),
and
Bern
hard
,
who
is
white
(
sentence

8
).
Since
Brian
's
color
is
not
mentioned
,
