Reason
ing
:
The
triangle
is
above
the
red
sphere
,
and
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
This
implies
that
the
blue
square
is
not
directly
above
or
below
the
red
sphere
.
The
red
sphere
's
position
is
only
mentioned
as
being
above
the
triangle
,
not
in
relation
to
the
blue
square
.
Since
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
and
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
triangle
,
we
cannot
conclude
the
red
sphere
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
