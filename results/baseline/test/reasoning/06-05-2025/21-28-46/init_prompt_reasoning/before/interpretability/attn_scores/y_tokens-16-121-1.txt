Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Brian
,
who
is
a
lion
according
to
sentence

9
.
Since
Julius
,
who
is
also
a
lion
,
is
green
(
sentence

4
),
it
is
possible
that
Brian
's
color
is
also
green
.
However
,
there
is
no
direct
information
about
Brian
's
color
in
the
given
sentences
.
The
only
information
about
Brian
's
color
is
that
Julius
,
a
lion
,
is
green
,
but
this
does
not
necessarily
imply
that
Brian
,
another
lion
,
has
the
same
color
