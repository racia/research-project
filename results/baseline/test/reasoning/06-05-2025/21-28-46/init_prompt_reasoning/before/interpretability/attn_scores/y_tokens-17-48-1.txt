Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relative
position
of
the
blue
square
with
respect
to
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
triangle
is
above
the
blue
square
(
sentence

2
),
it
means
the
blue
square
is
below
the
triangle
.
Also
,
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
(
sentence

1
).
This
implies
that
the
blue
square
is
also
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
as
it
is
below
the
triangle
.
