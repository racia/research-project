Reason
ing
:
Since
the
hallway
is
not
directly
mentioned
as
being
adjacent
to
the
garden
,
we
need
to
find
the
shortest
path
from
the
hallway
to
the
garden
.
We
know
the
kitchen
is
south
of
the
garden
and
north
of
the
hallway
,
which
means
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
kitchen
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
go
from
the
hallway
to
the
kitchen
,
and
then
from
the
kitchen
to
the
garden
.
