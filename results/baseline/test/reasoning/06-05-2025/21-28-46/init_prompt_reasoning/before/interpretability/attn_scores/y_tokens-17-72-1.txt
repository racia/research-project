Reason
ing
:
The
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
,
and
the
blue
square
is
above
the
yellow
square
.
This
information
does
not
directly
relate
the
blue
square
to
the
triangle
.

,
since
the
yellow
square
is
between
the
triangle
and
the
blue
square
,
we
can
infer
that
the
blue
square
is
not
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
.
