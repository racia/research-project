Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
information
about
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
relative
to
the
triangle
.
The
sentences
only
mention
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
(
below
the
red
square
)
and
the
triangle
's
position
(
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
),
but
not
their
relative
positions
.
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
we
can
infer
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
.
