Reason
ing
:
Since
the
bedroom
is
north
of
the
garden
(
sentence

4
),
and
the
office
is
north
of
the
hallway
(
sentence

1
),
we
can
infer
that
the
office
is
also
north
of
the
bedroom
.
Additionally
,
the
office
is
west
of
the
garden
(
sentence

3
),
which
means
it
is
not
directly
north
of
the
bedroom
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
move
east
from
the
bedroom
to
the
hallway
,
and
then
north
to
reach
the
office
.
Answer
:
east
,
north
