The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Lily
,
who
is
a
lion
.
Since
lions
are
not
mentioned
as
having
a
specific
color
in
the
context
sentences
,
we
need
to
infer
the
answer
based
on
the
colors
of
other
lions
.
Brian
is
a
lion
and
is
green
,
which
suggests
that
lions
can
be
green
.
However
,
we
cannot
conclude
that
Lily
is
green
without
additional
information
.
Since
Lily
is
also
a
lion
,
we
can
assume
that
she
might
have
a
similar
color
to
Brian
,
which
is
green
