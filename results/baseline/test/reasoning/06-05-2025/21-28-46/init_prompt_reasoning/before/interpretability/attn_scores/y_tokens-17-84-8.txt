Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
blue
square
is
above
the
red
square
(
from
sentence

1
),
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
(
from
sentence

2
).
This
means
that
the
blue
square
is
not
directly
above
the
triangle
,
since
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
and
the
blue
square
is
above
the
red
square
.
