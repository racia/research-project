Reason
ing
:
Since
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
suitcase
(
sentence

2
),
and
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
suitcase
(
sentence

3
),
it
is
logical
to
conclude
that
the
container
is
also
bigger
than
the
chest
.
This
means
that
the
container
has
enough
space
to
accommodate
the
chest
,
which
in
turn
has
enough
space
to
accommodate
the
box
of
chocolates
(
sentence

4
).
Therefore
,
it
is
possible
to
fit
the
suitcase
inside
the
container
.
