Reason
ing
:
The
suitcase
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
(
10
),
and
the
chocolate
is
smaller
than
the
box
(
1
).
The
box
fits
inside
the
suitcase
(
not
explicitly
stated
,
but
can
be
inferred
).
This
implies
that
the
suitcase
is
not
smaller
than
the
box
,
and
therefore
,
the
suitcase
does
not
fit
inside
the
chocolate
.
