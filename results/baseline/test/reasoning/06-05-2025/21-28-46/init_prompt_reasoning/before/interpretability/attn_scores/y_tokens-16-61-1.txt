Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
color
of
Julius
,
who
is
a
rh
ino
according
to
sentence

6
.
Since
the
color
of
a
rh
ino
is
not
mentioned
,
we
need
to
look
for
a
connection
between
Julius
and
a
color
.
Sentence

5
mentions
Bern
hard
,
who
is
also
a
lion
,
and
is
yellow
.
Julius
is
not
mentioned
as
being
yellow
,
but
Bern
hard
is
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Julius
's
color
is
not
mentioned
,
but
Bern
hard
's
color
is
yellow
.
