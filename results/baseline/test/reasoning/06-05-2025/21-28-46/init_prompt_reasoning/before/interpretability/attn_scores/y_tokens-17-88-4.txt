Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
(
from
sentence

2
).
We
also
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
(
from
sentence

1
).
Since
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
,
it
doesn
't
directly
tell
us
about
the
relation
between
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
yellow
square
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
above
the
yellow
square
,
because
if
it
were
,
the
red
sphere
would
be
above
the
yellow
