Reason
ing
:
The
box
of
chocolates
fits
inside
the
chest
(
sentence

3
),
and
the
chocolate
fits
inside
the
container
(
sentence

4
).
This
implies
that
the
chocolate
is
not
a
container
,
but
rather
a
small
object
.
Since
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
suitcase
(
sentence

1
),
it
is
unlikely
that
the
chest
would
fit
inside
the
chocolate
,
which
is
much
smaller
.
