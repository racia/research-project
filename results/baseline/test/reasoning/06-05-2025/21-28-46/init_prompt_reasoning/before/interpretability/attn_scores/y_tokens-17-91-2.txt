Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
red
square
.
We
know
that
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
but
this
information
doesn
't
provide
a
direct
answer
about
the
red
sphere
's
position
relative
to
the
red
square
.
The
only
information
we
have
is
that
the
red
square
is
below
the
yellow
square
,
which
doesn
't
give
us
a
clear
answer
about
the
red
sphere
's
position
relative
to
the
red
square
.
