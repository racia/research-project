From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
.
We
need
to
determine
if
the
blue
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
blue
square
is
not
directly
related
to
the
red
