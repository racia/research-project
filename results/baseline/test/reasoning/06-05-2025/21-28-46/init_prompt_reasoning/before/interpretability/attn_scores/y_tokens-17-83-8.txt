Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
information
that
suggests
the
triangle
is
below
the
red
square
.
The
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
and
the
red
square
is
above
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
triangle
is
not
directly
related
to
the
red
square
,
we
cannot
determine
if
the
triangle
is
below
the
red
square
without
additional
information
.

No
