Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
relation
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
blue
square
.
However
,
there
is
no
direct
information
provided
about
the
red
sphere
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
The
only
information
given
is
about
the
yellow
square
's
position
relative
to
the
red
sphere
(
yellow
square
is
below
the
red

)
and
the
blue
square
's
position
relative
to
the
yellow
square
(
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
).
Since
there
is
no
explicit
information
about
the
red
sphere
's
position
