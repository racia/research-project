Reason
ing
:
Since
the
kitchen
is
north
of
the
bathroom
(
sentence

5
),
and
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
office
(
sentence

2
),
we
can
infer
that
the
office
is
east
of
the
kitchen
.
Additionally
,
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
office
,
which
means
the
office
is
not
directly
north
of
the
kitchen
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
go
east
from
the
kitchen
to
reach
the
office
.
