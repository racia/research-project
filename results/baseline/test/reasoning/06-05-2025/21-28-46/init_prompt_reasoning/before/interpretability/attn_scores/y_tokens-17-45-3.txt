Reason
ing
:
We
don
't
have
any
information
about
the
red
square
's
vertical
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
The
sentences
only
provide
information
about
the
red
sphere
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
(
to
the
right
)
and
its
position
relative
to
the
red
square
(
below
).
Since
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
red
square
,
we
can
't
infer
anything
about
the
red
square
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
