Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Julie
's
location
before
the
bedroom
,
but
the
context
sentences
provided
do
not
mention
Julie
's
location
before
the
bedroom
.
The
sentences
only
mention
Mary
's
and
Bill
's
locations
,
which
are
the
kitchen
and
cinema
,
respectively
.
Since
Julie
's
location
is
not
mentioned
,
we
cannot
determine
where
Julie
was
before
the
bedroom
.
Answer
