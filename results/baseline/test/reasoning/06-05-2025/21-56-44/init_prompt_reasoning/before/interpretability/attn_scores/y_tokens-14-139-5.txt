Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
new
information
provided
about
Fred

The
previous
information
about
Fred

4
,
which
mentioned
that
Fred
went
to
the
bedroom
yesterday
and
moved
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
.
Since
this
new
information
does
not
contradict
or
update
Fred

,
we
can
still
conclude
that
Fred
was
in
the
