Reason
ing
:
Mary
and
Daniel
are
mentioned
together
in
both
sentences
,
and
since
they
went

to
the
office
after
being
in
the
hallway
,
it
is
likely
that
Mary
is
still
with
Daniel
.
The
sentences
do
not
specify
that
they
separated
or
changed
locations
,
so
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
Mary
is
still
with
Daniel
.
