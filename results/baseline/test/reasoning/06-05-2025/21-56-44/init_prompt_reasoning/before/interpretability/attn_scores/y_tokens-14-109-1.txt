Reason
ing
:
Since
Fred
went
to
the
cinema
this
morning
,
and
he
travelled
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
,
it
implies
that
Fred
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
cinema
.
The
only
information
provided
about
Fred
's
whereabouts
before
going
to
the
kitchen
is
that
he
went
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Fred
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
kitchen
,
and
since
he
went
to
the
cinema
this
morning
,
it
is
likely
that
Fred
was
at
the
kitchen
before
going
to
the
cinema
.
