Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
went
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
,
and
she
went
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
,
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
bedroom
.
The
only
place
mentioned
before
the
bedroom
is
the
office
,
where
she
went
this
afternoon
.
However
,
that
's
not
the
correct
answer
,
as
the
question
asks
about
where
she
was
before
going
to
the
bedroom
,
not
before
going
to
the
office
.
The
correct
answer
lies
in
the
previous
day
's
events
.
Mary
went
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
,
