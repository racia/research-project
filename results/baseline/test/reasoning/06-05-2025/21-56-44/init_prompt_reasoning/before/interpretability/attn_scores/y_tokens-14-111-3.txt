Reason
ing
:
Since
Bill
travelled
to
the
school
this
afternoon
,
and
there
is
no
mention
of
Bill
's
location
before
this
afternoon
,
we
can
infer
that
Bill
was
not
at
the
school
before
this
afternoon
.
The
only
other
information
we
have
is
that
Bill
went
back
to
the
office
this
morning
(
from
a
previous
conversation
),
but
this
is
not
relevant
to
the
question
about
Bill
's
location
before
the
school
.
