Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
went
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
,
and
yesterday
she
travelled
to
the
cinema
,
it
is
logical
to
assume
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
kitchen
.
The
only
other
information
provided
is
that
she
went
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
,
which
implies
that
she
was
not
at
the
kitchen
yesterday
.
Therefore
,
it
is
inferred
that
she
was
at
the
cinema
yesterday
.
