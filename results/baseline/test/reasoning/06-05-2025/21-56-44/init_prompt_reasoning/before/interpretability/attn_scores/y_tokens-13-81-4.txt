ing
:
Sandra
is
mentioned
in
the
first
sentence
as
journey
ing
to
the
kitchen
with
Daniel

is
no
mention
of
her
leaving
the
kitchen
or
going
anywhere
else
.
Therefore
,
it
is
inferred
that
Sandra
is
still

The
second
sentence
mentions
that
they

in
the
kitchen
.

Sandra
is
with
Daniel
,
it
is
inferred
that
Sandra
is
now
in
the
garden
.
