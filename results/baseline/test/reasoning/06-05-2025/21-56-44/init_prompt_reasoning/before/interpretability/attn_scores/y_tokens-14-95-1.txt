Reason
ing
:
Since
Fred
went
to
the
office
this
morning
,
and
he
didn
't
go
to
the
office
yesterday
,
it
means
he
travelled
to
the
office
this
morning
.
Before
going
to
the
office
,
Fred
must
have
been
somewhere
else
.
The
only
information
we
have
about
Fred
's
previous
location
is
that
he
went
to
the
cinema
yesterday
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Fred
was
at
the
cinema
before
going
to
the
office
.
