Reason
ing
:
The
question
is
not
about
Julie
,
but
about
Mary
.
The
context
sentences
provided
do
not
mention
Mary
's
whereabouts
before
the
kitchen
.
The
previous
question
about
Mary
's
whereabouts
before
the
kitchen
was
answered
as
"
park
"
based
on
the
assumption
of
sentence

4
(
not
provided
).
However
,
without
that
sentence
,
we
cannot
determine
Mary
's
whereabouts
before
the
kitchen
.
Answer

Not
