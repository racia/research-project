Reason
ing
:
Daniel
is
mentioned
in
two
sentences
,
and
in
the
first
sentence
,
he
is
with
Sandra
,
and
they
go
to
the
bedroom
.
In
the
second
sentence
,
Sandra
goes
back
to
the
garden
,
but
it
does
not
specify
what
happens
to
Daniel
.
Since
Sandra
goes
back
to
the
garden
,
it
implies
that
she
was
initially
in
the
garden
,
and
Daniel
was
with
her
.
Therefore
,
it
is
likely
that
Daniel
is
still
in
the
bedroom
.
