Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
went
back
to
the
office
this
afternoon
,
there
is
no
information
provided
about
her
location
before
going
back
to
the
office
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
she
was
not
at
the
office
yesterday
,
as
Bill
travelled
to
the
park
yesterday
,
and
Mary
went
back
to
the
office
this
afternoon
.
Therefore
,
it
is
unknown
where
Mary
was
before
going
back
to
the
office
.
