Reason
ing
:
Since
Bill
moved
to
the
cinema
this
morning
(
sentence

7
),
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
cinema
.
The
only
information
provided
about
Bill
's
previous
location
is
that
he
moved
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
(
sentence

3
from
the
previous
task
).
However
,
this
information
is
not
relevant
to
the
current
question
,
which
asks
about
Bill
's
location
before
moving
to
the
cinema
.
Since
the
question
does
not
provide
any
information
about
Bill
's
location
before
the
cinema
,
the
answer
is
