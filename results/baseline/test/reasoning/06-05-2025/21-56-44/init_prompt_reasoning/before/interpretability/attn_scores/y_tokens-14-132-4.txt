Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Julie
's
location
before
the
school
,
but
the
context
sentences
do
not
mention
Julie
going
to
the
school
.
The
context
sentence
"
This
afternoon
Julie
went
back
to
the
office
"
suggests
that
Julie
was
somewhere
else
before
going
back
to
the
office
.
However
,
there
is
no
information
about
Julie
's
location
before
going
to
the
office
,
which
is
not
the
same
as
the
school
.
