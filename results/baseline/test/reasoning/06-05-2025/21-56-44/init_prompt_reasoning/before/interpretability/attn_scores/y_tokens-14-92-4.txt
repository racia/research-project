Reason
ing
:
The
new
information
provided
in
context
sentences

12
and

13
does
not
mention
Julie
's
location
.
The
previous
information
we
had
about
Julie
was
that
she
moved
to
the
school
this
morning
(
from
context
sentence

7
).
Since
there
is
no
new
information
about
Julie
's
location
,
we
can
still
infer
that
Julie
was
at
the
school
before
going
to
the
park
(
from
context
sentence

10
).
