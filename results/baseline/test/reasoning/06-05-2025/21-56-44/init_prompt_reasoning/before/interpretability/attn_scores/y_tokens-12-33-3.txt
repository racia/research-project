Reason
ing
:
John
is
mentioned
in
both
sentences
,
and
his
location
is
specified
in
one
sentence
,
but
not
in
the
other
.
Since
he
is
going
back
to
the
bathroom
with
Daniel
in
the
first
sentence
,
it
is
likely
that
he
is
in
the
bathroom
.
However
,
in
the
second
sentence
,
he
is
going
to
the
hallway
with
Daniel
,
which
means
he
is
likely
in
the
hallway
.
Answer
:
hallway
