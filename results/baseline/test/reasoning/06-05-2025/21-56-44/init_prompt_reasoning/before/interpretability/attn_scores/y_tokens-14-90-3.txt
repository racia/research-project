Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
went
back
to
the
kitchen
this
afternoon
,
we
know
she
was
somewhere
else
before
going
back
to
the
kitchen
.
We
also
know
that
Mary
went
to
the
park
yesterday
(
from
context
sentence

4
),
but
we
don
't
have
any
information
about
her
activities
this
afternoon
before
going
back
to
the
kitchen
.
Therefore
,
we
can
only
infer
that
Mary
was
at
the
kitchen
before
going
back
to
the
kitchen
,
which
is
not
a
very
helpful
answer
.
However
,
we
can
look
at
the
previous
information
