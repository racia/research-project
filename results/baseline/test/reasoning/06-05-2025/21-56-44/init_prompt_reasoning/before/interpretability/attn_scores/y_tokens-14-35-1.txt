Reason
ing
:
Since
Fred
journey
ed
to
the
park
this
morning
,
and
yesterday
he
travelled
to
the
school
,
it
is
likely
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
the
park
.
The
only
other
information
we
have
is
that
Julie
went
to
the
bedroom
yesterday
,
but
there
is
no
connection
between
Julie
's
action
and
Fred
's
journey
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Fred
was
at
home
before
the
park
.
