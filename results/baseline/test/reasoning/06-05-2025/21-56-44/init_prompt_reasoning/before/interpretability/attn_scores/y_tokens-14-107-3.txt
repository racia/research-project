Reason
ing
:
Since
Julie
went
back
to
the
kitchen
this
afternoon
,
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
returning
to
the
kitchen
.
The
previous
sentence
(
7
)
does
not
mention
Julie
's
location
before
the
kitchen
,
but
the
sentence
before
that
(
8
)
mentions
Fred
's
movement
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
.
Since
Julie
went
back
to
the
kitchen
this
afternoon
,
it
is
likely
that
she
was
at
the
kitchen
yesterday
,
and
then
returned
to
it
this
afternoon
.
