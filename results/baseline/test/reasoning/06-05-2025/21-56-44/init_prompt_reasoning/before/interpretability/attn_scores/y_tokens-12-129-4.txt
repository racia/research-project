Reason
ing
:
Sandra
is
mentioned
in
sentence

10
,
where
she
is
traveling
to
the
kitchen
with
John
.
There
is
no
mention
of
Sandra
's
location
after
that
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Sandra
is
still
in
the
kitchen
since
John
and
Daniel
are
in
the
garden
(
sentence

11
),
which
implies
that
Sandra
is
not
with
John
in
the
garden
.
