Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
travelled
to
the
office
this
morning
,
we
need
to
find
out
where
she
was
before
that
.
From
sentence

1
,
we
know
that
Mary
went
to
the
cinema
yesterday
.
This
means
that
she
was
not
at
the
office
yesterday
.
From
sentence

3
,
we
know
that
Mary
travelled
to
the
office
this
morning
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Mary
was
not
at
the
office
yesterday
,
and
she
must
have
been
somewhere
else
.
The
only
other
information
we
have
about
Mary
's
whereabouts
is
