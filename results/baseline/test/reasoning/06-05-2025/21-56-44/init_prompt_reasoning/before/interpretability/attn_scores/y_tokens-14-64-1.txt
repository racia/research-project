Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
went
to
the
park
yesterday
,
it
implies
that
she
was
not
in
the
kitchen
yesterday
.
The
question
asks
about
where
she
was
before
the
kitchen
,
which
means
we
need
to
find
out
where
she
was
this
morning
.
Since
she
went
back
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
,
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
coming
back
to
the
kitchen
.
The
only
information
we
have
is
that
she
went
back
to
the
kitchen
,
which
means
she
was
not
in
the
kitchen
before
this
morning
.
