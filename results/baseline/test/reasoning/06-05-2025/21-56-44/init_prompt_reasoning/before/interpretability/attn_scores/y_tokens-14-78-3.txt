Reason
ing
:
Since
Julie
went
back
to
the
kitchen
this
evening
,
and
she
moved
to
the
school
this
afternoon
,
we
can
infer
that
Julie
was
at
the
school
this
afternoon
.
However
,
we
are
asked
about
Julie
's
whereabouts
before
the
park
,
which
is
not
mentioned
in
the
given
sentences
.
We
can
only
infer
that
Julie
was
somewhere
else
before
the
park
,
but
we
cannot
determine
a
specific
location
.
