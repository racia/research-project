Reason
ing
:
Sandra
is
mentioned
in
the
first
sentence
,
where
she
went
to
the
hallway
with
Daniel
.
There
is
no
mention
of
Sandra
's
location
in
the
second
sentence
,
which
only
mentions
John
and
Daniel
going
back
to
the
kitchen
.
Since
Sandra
's
location
is
not
specified
in
the
second
sentence
,
we
can
only
rely
on
the
information
from
the
first
sentence
.
