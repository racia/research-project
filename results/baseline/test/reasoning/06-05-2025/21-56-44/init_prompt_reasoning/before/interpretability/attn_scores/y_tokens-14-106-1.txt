Reason
ing
:
Since
Bill
went
back
to
the
park
yesterday
,
it
implies
that
he
was
at
the
park
the
previous
day
.
However
,
the
question
asks
about
where
Bill
was
before
he
journey
ed
to
the
school
this
morning
.
Since
Bill
went
back
to
the
park
yesterday
,
it
is
likely
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
he
went
back
to
the
park
.
The
only
information
provided
is
that
he
went
back
to
the
park
yesterday
,
but
it
does
not
specify
where
he
was
before
that
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
pinpoint
