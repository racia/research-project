Reason
ing
:
Sandra
and
Mary
travelled
to
the
hallway
,
which
implies
that
Sandra
was
with
Mary
in
the
hallway

John
travelled
to
the
garden
,
but
this
doesn
't
provide
any
information
about
Sandra
's
location
.
Since
Sandra
was
with
Mary
in
the
hallway
,
it
's
likely
that
Sandra
is
still
in
the
hallway
.
