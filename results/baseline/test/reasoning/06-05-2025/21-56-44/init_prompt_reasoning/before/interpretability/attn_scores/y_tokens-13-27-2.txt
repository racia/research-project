Reason
ing
:
Mary
is
mentioned
in
the
first
sentence
as
going
to
the
bathroom
with
John
.
There
is
no
mention
of
her
leaving
the
bathroom
or
going
anywhere
else
.
Therefore
,
it
is
inferred
that
Mary
is
still
in
the
bathroom
.
However
,
the
second
sentence
mentions
that
they
went
to
the
kitchen
,
which
implies
that
Mary
is
no
longer
in
the
bathroom
.
Since
the
question
asks
about
Mary
's
current
location
,
it
is
inferred
that
Mary
is
in
the
kitchen
.

kitchen
