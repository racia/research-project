Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
before
the
cinema
,
and
the
context
sentence

10
states
that
Mary
travelled
to
the
cinema
this
morning
.
This
implies
that
Mary
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
cinema
.
Since
there
is
no
information
provided
about
Mary
's
location
before
this
morning
,
we
cannot
determine
a
specific
location
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Mary
was
not
at
the
cinema
before
this
morning
.
