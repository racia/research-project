Reason
ing
:
The
question
is
asking
about
Julie
's
location
before
the
cinema
,
but
the
context
sentences
only
mention
Julie
's
journey
to
the
school
this
evening
,
not
the
cinema
.
Since
the
question
is
asking
about
the
cinema
,
we
need
to
go
back
to
the
previous
context
sentences
to
find
the
answer
.
Julie
travelled
to
the
cinema
this
afternoon
,
and
before
that
,
she
travelled
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
.
This
means
that
Julie
was
in
the
bedroom
before
she
went
to
the
cinema
.

bedroom
