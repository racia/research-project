Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
moved
to
the
office
yesterday
(
sentence

4
),
and
she
travelled
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
(
sentence

2
),
it
is
logical
to
infer
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
bedroom
.
The
only
other
information
provided
is
that
Bill
moved
to
the
park
this
morning
(
sentence

1
),
which
does
not
directly
relate
to
Mary
's
location
.
Therefore
,
we
can
conclude
that
Mary
was
at
the
office
before
moving
to
the
bedroom
.
