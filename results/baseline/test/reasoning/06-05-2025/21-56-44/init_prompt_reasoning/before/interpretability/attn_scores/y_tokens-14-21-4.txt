Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
before
the
cinema
,
and
we
know
that
Mary
went
back
to
the
cinema
this
afternoon
(
sentence

10
from
the
previous
task
).
However
,
we
do
not
have
any
information
about
Mary
's
location
before
going
back
to
the
cinema
.
The
sentences
provided
do
not
mention
Mary
's
location
at
all
,
and
the
only
information
about
Mary
's
movement
is
that
she
went
back
to
the
cinema
this
afternoon
.
