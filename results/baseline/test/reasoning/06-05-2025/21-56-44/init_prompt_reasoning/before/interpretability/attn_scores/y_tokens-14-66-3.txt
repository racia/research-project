Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Bill
's
location
before
he
moved
to
the
cinema
.
We
know
that
Bill
moved
to
the
cinema
this
afternoon
,
which
means
he
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
cinema
.
Since
Bill
journey
ed
to
the
office
this
evening
,
it
implies
that
he
was
not
at
the
office
before
moving
to
the
cinema
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
find
out
where
Bill
was
before
moving
to
the
cinema
.
