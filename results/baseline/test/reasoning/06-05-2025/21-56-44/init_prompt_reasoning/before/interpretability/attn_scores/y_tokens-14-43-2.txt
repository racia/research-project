Reason
ing
:
The
question
is
asking
about
Fred
's
location
before
going
back
to
the
kitchen
,
but
the
context
sentences
provided
do
not
mention
Fred
's
location
.
The
sentences
only
mention
Mary
and
Julie
's
locations
,
which
are
the
office
and
bedroom
,
respectively
.
Since
Fred
's
location
is
not
mentioned
,
we
cannot
determine
where
Fred
was
before
going
back
to
the
kitchen
.
