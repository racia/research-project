:
Since
Bill
moved
to
the
office
yesterday
,
it
implies
that
he
was
not
in
the
kitchen
yesterday
.
The
question
asks
about
where
he
was
before
the
kitchen
,
which
means
we
need
to
find
out
where
he
was
this

.
Since
he
travelled
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
,
it

that
he
was
somewhere
else

The
only
information
we
have
is
that
he
travelled
to
the
kitchen
,
which
means
he
was
not
in
the
kitchen
before
this
morning
.
