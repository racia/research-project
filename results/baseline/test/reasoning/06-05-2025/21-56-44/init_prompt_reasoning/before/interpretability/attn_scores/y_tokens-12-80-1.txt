Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
and
John
journey
ed
to
the
kitchen
in
sentence

1
,
it
implies
that
John
is
present
in
the
kitchen
.
Later
,
in
sentence

2
,
Mary
and
John
went
to
the
bathroom
,
which
means
John
is
also
present
in
the
bathroom
.
Since
the
question
asks
about
John
's
current
location
,
I
will
consider
the
most
recent
action
,
which
is
going
to
the
bathroom
.
Answer

bathroom
