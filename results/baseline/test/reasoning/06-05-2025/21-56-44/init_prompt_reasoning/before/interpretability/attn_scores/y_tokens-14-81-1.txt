Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Bill
's
location
before
he
travelled
to
the
school
.
Since
Bill
went
back
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
,
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
going
back
to
the
kitchen
.
The
only
other
information
we
have
about
Bill
's
location
is
that
he
travelled
to
the
school
this
morning
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Bill
was
in
the
kitchen
yesterday
and
went
to
the
school
this
morning
.
