Reason
ing
:
Since
Fred
travelled
to
the
kitchen
this
evening
(
sentence

10
),
and
there
is
no
information
about
his
whereabouts
before
that
,
we
can
infer
that
Fred
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
kitchen
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Fred
was
not
at
the
kitchen
this
morning
,
as
Bill
travelled
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
(
sentence

9
),
and
Fred
's
location
is
not
mentioned
in
relation
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
.
