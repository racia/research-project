Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Bill
's
location
before
he
travelled
to
the
school
.
Since
Bill
moved
to
the
park
yesterday
,
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
park
.
The
only
other
information
provided
is
that
Bill
travelled
to
the
school
this
morning
,
which
means
he
was
not
at
the
school
before
moving
to
the
park
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
find
out
where
Bill
was
before
moving
to
the
park
.
