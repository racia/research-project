Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
information
provided
about
Mary
's
location
before
the
bedroom
.
The
sentences
only
mention
Mary
's
movement
to
the
park
this
afternoon
,
but
not
her
location
before
that
.
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
before
the
bedroom
,
but
the
bedroom
is
not
mentioned
in
the
given
sentences
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
Mary
's
location
before
the
bedroom
.
