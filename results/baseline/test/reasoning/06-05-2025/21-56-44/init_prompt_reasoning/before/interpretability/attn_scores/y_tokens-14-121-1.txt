Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Bill
's
location
before
going
to
the
cinema
.
Since
Bill
went
back
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
,
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
going
back
to
the
kitchen
.
The
only
information
provided
about
Bill
's
location
before
going
back
to
the
kitchen
is
that
he
went
to
the
cinema
this
morning
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Bill
was
in
the
kitchen
before
going
to
the
cinema
.
