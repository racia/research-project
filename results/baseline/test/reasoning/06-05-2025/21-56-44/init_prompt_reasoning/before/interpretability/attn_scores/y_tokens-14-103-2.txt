Reason
ing
:
Since
Julie
went
to
the
park
this
afternoon
,
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
arriving
at
the
park
.
The
only
information
provided
about
Julie
's
previous
location
is
that
she
journey
ed
to
the
office
this
morning
(
from
context
sentences

1
and

2
).
However
,
this
information
is
not
directly
related
to
her
location
before
the
park
.
We
need
to
find
a
connection
between
Julie
's
previous
location
and
her
current
location
,
which
is
the
park
.
