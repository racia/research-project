Reason
ing
:
Julie
went
back
to
the
office
this
afternoon
(
sentence

7
),
which
means
she
was
somewhere
before
going
back
to
the
office
.
Since
there
is
no
information
about
Julie
's
whereabouts
before
going
back
to
the
office
,
we
need
to
infer
it
.
However
,
we
know
that
Julie
went
to
the
cinema
yesterday
(
from
previous
context
sentences
),
and
there
is
no
information
about
her
being
at
the
kitchen
or
the
office
yesterday
.
Therefore
,
it
is
logical
to
assume
that
Julie
was
at
the
cinema
yesterday
and
