Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
new
information
about
Mary
in
these

already
knew

the
park
yesterday
(
from
context
sentence

4
)
and
went
back
to
the
kitchen
this
afternoon
(
from
context

We
still
don
't
have
any
information
about
Mary
's
activities
this
afternoon
before
going
back
to
the
kitchen
.
Answer
