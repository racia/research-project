Reason
ing
:
Since
Fred
travelled
to
the
school
this
afternoon
,
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
arriving
at
the
school
.
The
only
information
provided
about
Fred
's
previous
location
is
that
he
moved
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
(
from
context
sentence

9
).
However
,
this
information
is
not
directly
related
to
his
location
before
the
school
.
We
need
to
find
a
connection
between
Fred
's
previous
location
and
his
current
location
,
which
is
the
school
.
