Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Fred
's
location
before
he
went
to
the
office
.
We
know
that
Fred
went
to
the
cinema
this
morning
,
which
means
he
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
cinema
.
Since
Fred
went
to
the
office
this
afternoon
,
it
implies
that
he
was
not
at
the
office
before
going
to
the
cinema
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
find
out
where
Fred
was
before
going
to
the
cinema
.
