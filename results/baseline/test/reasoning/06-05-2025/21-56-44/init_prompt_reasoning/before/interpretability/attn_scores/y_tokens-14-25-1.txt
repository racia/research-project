Reason
ing
:
Since
Fred
went
back
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
,
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
going
back
to
the
bedroom
.
The
only
information
we
have
about
Fred
's
location
before
yesterday
is
that
he
went
to
the
office
yesterday
.
Since
he
went
back
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
,
it
's
likely
that
he
was
at
the
office
yesterday
and
then
went
back
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
.
