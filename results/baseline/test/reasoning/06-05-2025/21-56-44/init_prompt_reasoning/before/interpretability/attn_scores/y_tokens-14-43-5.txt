Reason
ing
:
The
question
is
asking
about
Bill
's
location
before
going
to
the
kitchen
,
but
the
context
sentences
provided
do
not
mention
Bill
's
location
.
The
sentences
only
mention
Mary
's
locations
,
which
are
the
kitchen
and
cinema
,
respectively
.
Since
Bill
's
location
is
not
mentioned
,
we
cannot
determine
where
Bill
was
before
going
to
the
kitchen
.
Answer
:
