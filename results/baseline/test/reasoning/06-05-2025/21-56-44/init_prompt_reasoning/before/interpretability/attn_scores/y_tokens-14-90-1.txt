Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
went
to
the
school
this
morning
,
and
we
know
she
went
to
the
park
yesterday
,
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
school
.
The
only
other
information
we
have
about
Mary
's
activities
is
that
she
journey
ed
to
the
school
this
morning
.
This
journey
implies
that
she
was
not
at
the
school
before
this
morning
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Mary
was
at
home
before
going
to
the
school
.
