Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
John
's
location
,
and
since
John
and
Daniel
moved
to
the
hallway
in
sentence

7
,
it
is
likely
that
John
is
in
the
hallway
.
However
,
John
and
Daniel
also
travelled
to
the
garden
in
sentence

8
,
which
means
John
's
location
is
not
fixed
to
the
hallway
alone
.
Therefore
,
John
's
location
is
ambiguous
and
could
be
either
the
hallway
or
the
garden
.
Answer
:
hallway
or
garden
