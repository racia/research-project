Reason
ing
:
Sandra
and
Mary
moved
to
the
hallway
,
and
then
they
went
back
to
the
kitchen
.
Since
Sandra
is
not
mentioned
as
leaving
the
hallway
,
it
can
be
inferred
that
she
is
still
in
the
hallway
or
has
moved
to
the
kitchen
with
Mary
.
Since
the
question
asks
about
Sandra
's
location
,
it
is
likely
that
she
is
in
the
hallway
or
the
kitchen
,
as
she
is
not
mentioned
as
being
in
a
different
location
.
