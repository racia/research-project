Reason
ing
:
The
question
is
asking
about
Bill
's
location
before
going
to
the
kitchen
.
The
context
sentence
mentions
that
Bill
moved
to
the
cinema
this
afternoon
(
from
context
sentence

13
),
but
it
does
not
mention
his
location
before
going
to
the
cinema
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Bill
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
cinema
.
The
only
information
we
have
about
Bill
's
previous
location
is
that
he
travelled
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
(
from
context
sentence

12
).
Therefore
,
it
is
logical
to
assume
