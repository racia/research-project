Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
before
going
to
the
cinema
.
Since
Mary
moved
to
the
office
yesterday
,
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
that
.
Mary
travelled
to
the
cinema
this
morning
,
which
means
she
was
not
at
the
cinema
yesterday
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
find
out
where
Mary
was
yesterday
.
Answer

office
