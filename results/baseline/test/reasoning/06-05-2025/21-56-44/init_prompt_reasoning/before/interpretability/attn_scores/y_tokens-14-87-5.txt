Reason
ing
:
Since
Fred
went
back
to
the
school
this
afternoon
,
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
going
back
to
the
school
.
The
only
information
we
have
about
Fred
's
previous
location
is
that
he
went
to
the
office
this
afternoon
.
Therefore
,
it
is
logical
to
infer
that
Fred
was
at
the
office
before
going
back
to
the
school
.
