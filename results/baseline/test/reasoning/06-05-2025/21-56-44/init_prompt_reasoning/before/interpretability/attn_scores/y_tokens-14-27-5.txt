Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Fred
's
whereabouts
before
the
office
,
but
the
context
sentences
provided
do
not
mention
Fred
going
to
the
office
.
The
sentences
only
mention
Bill
's
movement
to
the
kitchen
this
evening
(
sentence

15
)
and
Fred
's
journey
to
the
school
this
afternoon
(
sentence

16
).
Since
Fred
's
movement
is
not
related
to
the
office
,
we
cannot
infer
his
whereabouts
before
the
office
.
Answer
:
not
