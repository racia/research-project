Reason
ing
:
Since
John
and
Daniel
went
to
the
hallway
together
,
and
then
they
went
back
to
the
garden
,
it
implies
that
they
moved
as
a
pair
.
There
is
no
indication
that
they
separated
or
went
to
different
locations
.
Therefore
,
it
is
likely
that
Daniel
is
in
the
same
location
as
John
,
which
is
the
garden
.
