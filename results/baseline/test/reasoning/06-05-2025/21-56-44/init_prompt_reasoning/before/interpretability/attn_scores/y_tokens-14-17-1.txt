Reason
ing
:
Since
Fred
moved
to
the
park
this
morning
,
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
park
.
The
only
information
provided
about
Fred
's
location
before
moving
to
the
park
is
that
he
went
back
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
.
This
suggests
that
Fred
was
somewhere
else
before
going
back
to
the
kitchen
,
and
since
he
moved
to
the
park
this
morning
,
it
is
likely
that
Fred
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
park
.
