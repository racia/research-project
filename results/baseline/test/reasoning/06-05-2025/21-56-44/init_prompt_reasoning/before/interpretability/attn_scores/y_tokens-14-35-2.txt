Reason
ing
:
Since
Fred
went
to
the
bedroom
this
afternoon
,
and
Bill
moved
to
the
park
this
morning
,
we
can
infer
that
Fred
was
somewhere
else
before
the
park
.
The
only
information
we
have
is
that
Fred
went
to
the
bedroom
,
which
suggests
that
he
was
at
home
before
going
to
the
bedroom
.
Therefore
,
we
can
conclude
that
Fred
was
at
home
before
the
park
.
