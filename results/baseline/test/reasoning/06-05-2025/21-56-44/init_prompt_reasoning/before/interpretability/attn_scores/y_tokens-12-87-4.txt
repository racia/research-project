Reason
ing
:
John
is
mentioned
in
both
sentences

10
and

11
,
which
state
that
John
moved
to
the
garden
and
the
kitchen
,
respectively
.
Since
John
can
't
be
in
two
places
at
once
,
we
need
to
consider
the
most
recent
movement
.
Sentence

11
is
more
recent
,
so
John
is
currently
in
the
kitchen
.
Answer
:
kitchen
