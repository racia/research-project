Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
information
about
Bill
's
location
before
going
to
the
school
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Bill
was
not
at
the
school
the
day
before
,
since
he
went
to
the
school
this
afternoon
.
We
also
know
that
Bill
was
not
at
the
office
this
morning
(
from
previous
context
).
Therefore
,
we
cannot
pinpoint
a
specific
location
where
Bill
was
before
going
to
the
school
.
