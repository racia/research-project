Reason
ing
:
Since
Daniel
is
mentioned
in
both
sentences
,
and
he
is
moving
or
travelling
with
someone
else
,
it
's
likely
that
he
is
in
a
location
with
the
person
he
is
with
.
In
sentence

1
,
he
is
moving
to
the
bathroom
with
Sandra
,
and
in
sentence

2
,
he
is
travelling
to
the
garden
with
John
.
This
suggests
that
Daniel
is
currently
in
the
garden
,
as
he
is
last
mentioned
there
.
