Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
journey
ed
to
the
kitchen
this
afternoon
,
and
she
went
to
the
cinema
this
morning
,
it
is
likely
that
she
was
at
the
cinema
before
going
to
the
kitchen
.
However
,
we
also
know
that
Mary
went
to
the
bedroom
yesterday
,
which
could
be
a
previous
location
.
Since
the
question
asks
about
"
before
the
kitchen
",
we
need
to
consider
the
most
recent
location
before
the
kitchen
,
which
would
be
the
cinema
.
Answer

cinema
