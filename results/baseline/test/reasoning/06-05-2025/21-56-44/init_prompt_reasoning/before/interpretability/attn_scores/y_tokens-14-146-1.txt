Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
went
back
to
the
park
yesterday
(
sentence

2
),
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
going
back
to
the
park
.
The
only
other
information
we
have
is
that
she
travelled
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
(
sentence

1
).
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Mary
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
kitchen
,
which
is
the
park
.
