Reason
ing
:
Since
Bill
went
to
the
school
yesterday
,
it
implies
that
he
was
at
the
school
the
previous
day
.
However
,
the
question
asks
about
where
Bill
was
before
the
cinema
,
which
is
this
morning
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
consider
the
context
sentence

1
,
which
states
that
Bill
moved
to
the
cinema
this
morning
.
This
implies
that
Bill
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
cinema
.
