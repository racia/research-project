Reason
ing
:
Since
Daniel
is
mentioned
in
both
sentences
,
and
he
is
going
back
to
a
location
with
someone
else
,
it
's
likely
that
he
is
in
a
location
with
the
person
he
is
with
.
In
sentence

4
,
he
is
going
back
to
the
bedroom
with
John
,
and
in
sentence

5
,
he
is
going
back
to
the
kitchen
with
Sandra
.
This
suggests
that
Daniel
is
currently
in
the
kitchen
,
as
he
is
last
mentioned
there
.
