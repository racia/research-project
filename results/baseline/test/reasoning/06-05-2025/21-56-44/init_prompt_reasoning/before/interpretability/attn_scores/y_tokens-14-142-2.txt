Reason
ing
:
Since
Julie
moved
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
(
sentence

6
),
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
kitchen
.
The
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
information
about
Julie
's
location
before
moving
to
the
kitchen
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Julie
was
not
at
the
school
,
as
Fred
went
back
to
the
school
yesterday
(
sentence

7
),
and
Julie
moved
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
,
which
suggests
that
Julie
was
not
at
the
school
before
moving
to
the
kitchen
.
