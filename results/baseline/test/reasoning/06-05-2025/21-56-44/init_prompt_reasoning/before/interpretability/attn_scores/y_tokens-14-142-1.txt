Reason
ing
:
Since
Bill
moved
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
(
sentence

4
),
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
kitchen
.
Since
he
travelled
to
the
school
this
morning
(
sentence

2
),
it
is
likely
that
he
was
at
home
or
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
kitchen
.
However
,
the
question
asks
about
where
Bill
was
before
the
school
,
not
before
the
kitchen
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
consider
the
information
provided
in
sentence

3
,
which
states
that
Mary
went
to
the
school
