Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Fred
's
location
before
travelling
to
the
kitchen
.
The
context
sentence

10
mentions
that
Fred
travelled
to
the
kitchen
this
afternoon
,
but
it
does
not
provide
any
information
about
Fred
's
location
before
that
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Fred
was
not
at
the
park
because
Bill
went
back
to
the
park
this
afternoon
,
and
Fred
was
at
the
kitchen
.
The
only
other
information
provided
is
that
Fred
travelled
to
the
school
yesterday
(
from
context
sentences

2
and

3
).
Therefore
