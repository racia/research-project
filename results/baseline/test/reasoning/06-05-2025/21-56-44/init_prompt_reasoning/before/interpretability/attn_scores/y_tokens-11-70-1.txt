Reason
ing
:
Sandra
went
back
to
the
hallway
,
and
then
she
went
back
to
the
kitchen
.
This
implies
that
she
was
in
the
hallway
initially
,
and
then
moved
to
the
kitchen
.
Since
she
went
back
to
the
kitchen
,
it
means
she
was
not
in
the
kitchen
initially
,
but
rather
came
from
somewhere
else
.
The
only
place
mentioned
is
the
hallway
,
so
it
's
likely
that
Sandra
is
currently
in
the
kitchen
.
