Reason
ing
:
Since
Julie
went
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
(
sentence

),
there
is
no
previous
location
mentioned

asks
about
where
Julie
was
before
the
bedroom

implies
that
Julie
was
not
mentioned
in
any
previous
context
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
a
specific
location
where
Julie
was
before
going
to
the
bedroom
.
