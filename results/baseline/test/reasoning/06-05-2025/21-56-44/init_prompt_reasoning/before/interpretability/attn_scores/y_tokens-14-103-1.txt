Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
travelled
to
the
office
this
morning
,
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
arriving
at
the
office
.
The
only
information
provided
about
Mary
's
previous
location
is
that
she
travelled
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
.
However
,
this
information
is
not
directly
related
to
her
location
before
the
office
.
We
need
to
find
a
connection
between
Mary
's
previous
location
and
her
current
location
,
which
is
the
office
.
