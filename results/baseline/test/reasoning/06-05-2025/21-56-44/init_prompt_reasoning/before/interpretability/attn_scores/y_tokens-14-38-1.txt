Reason
ing
:
Bill
moved
to
the
school
this
morning
,
and
yesterday
he
travelled
to
the
kitchen
.
This
implies
that
Bill
was
at
the
kitchen
yesterday
.
Since
he
moved
to
the
school
this
morning
,
it
is
likely
that
he
was
at
the
office
yesterday
,
as
he
was
at
the
kitchen
the
day
before
.
However
,
we
don
't
have
any
information
about
Bill
's
whereabouts
before
the
kitchen
,
so
we
can
't
pinpoint
his
exact
location
before
the
school
.
