Reason
ing
:
Since
Bill
travelled
to
the
school
yesterday
(
sentence

4
),
and
he
went
to
the
park
this
morning
(
sentence

2
),
it
is
logical
to
assume
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
park
.
The
only
information
provided
about
Bill
's
whereabouts
yesterday
is
that
he
travelled
to
the
school
(
sentence

4
),
but
it
does
not
specify
where
he
was
before
that
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
pinpoint
a
specific
location
where
Bill
was
before
going
to
the
park
.
