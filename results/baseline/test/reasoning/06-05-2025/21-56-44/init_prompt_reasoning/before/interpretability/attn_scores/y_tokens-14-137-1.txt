Reason
ing
:
Julie
moved
to
the
cinema
yesterday
,
and
then
journey
ed
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
.
This
implies
that
Julie
was
not
in
the
bedroom
yesterday
,
but
rather
somewhere
else
.
Since
Julie
moved
to
the
cinema
yesterday
,
it
is
likely
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
cinema
.
The
only
other
context
sentence
that
mentions
Julie
's
location
before
moving
to
the
cinema
is
sentence

1
,
which
states
that
Julie
moved
to
the
cinema
yesterday
.
Therefore
,
Julie
was
likely
at
a
location
other
than
