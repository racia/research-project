Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
moved
to
the
office
this
afternoon
(
sentence

7
),
and
she
moved
to
the
kitchen
this
evening
(
sentence

6
),
it
is
inferred
that
she
was
in
the
office
before
moving
to
the
kitchen
.
However
,
the
question
asks
about
where
she
was
before
the
office
,
which
means
we
need
to
look
at
the
previous
location
before
the
office
.
Since
she
moved
to
the
office
this
afternoon
,
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
office
.
The
only
previous
location
mentioned
