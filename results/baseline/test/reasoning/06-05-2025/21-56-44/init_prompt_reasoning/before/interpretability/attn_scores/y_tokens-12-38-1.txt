Reason
ing
:
Since
Daniel
is
mentioned
in
sentence

1
,
it
implies
that
he
was
in
the
kitchen
with
Mary
.
However
,
sentence

2
does
not
mention
Daniel
's
location
,
but
it
does
mention
Mary
's
journey
to
the
office
.
This
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
Daniel
is
not
with
Mary
,
as
they
could
have
gone
to
the
office
together
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
conclude
that
Daniel
is
not
in
the
kitchen
.
