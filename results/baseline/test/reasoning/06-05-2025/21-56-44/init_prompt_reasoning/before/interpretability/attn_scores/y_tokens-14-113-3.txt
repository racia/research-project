Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
before
going
to
the
office
.
According
to
sentence

11
,
Mary
travelled
to
the
office
this
evening
.
Since
the
question
asks
about
her
location
before
going
to
the
office
,
it
implies
that
we
need
to
find
her
location
before
this
evening
.

However
,
sentence

does
not
provide
