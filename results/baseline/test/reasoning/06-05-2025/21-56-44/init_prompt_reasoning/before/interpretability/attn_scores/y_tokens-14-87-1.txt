Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
went
back
to
the
park
this
morning
,
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
going
back
to
the
park
.
The
only
information
we
have
about
Mary
's
previous
location
is
that
she
travelled
to
the
bedroom
yesterday
.
Therefore
,
it
is
logical
to
infer
that
Mary
was
in
the
bedroom
before
going
back
to
the
park
.
