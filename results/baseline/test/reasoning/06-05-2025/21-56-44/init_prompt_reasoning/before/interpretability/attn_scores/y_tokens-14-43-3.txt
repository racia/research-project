Reason
ing
:
The
question
is
asking
about
Fred
's
location
before
going
to
the
school
.
The
context
sentence
mentions
that
Fred
went
to
the
school
this
afternoon
,
but
it
does
not
mention
his
location
before
going
to
the
school
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Fred
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
school
,
since
he
went
to
the
school
this
afternoon
.
The
only
information
we
have
about
Fred
's
previous
location
is
that
he
went
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
(
from
context
sentence

9
).
Therefore
,
it
is
