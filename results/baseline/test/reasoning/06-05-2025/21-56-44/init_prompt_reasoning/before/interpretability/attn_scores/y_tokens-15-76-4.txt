Reason
ing
:
Win
ona
is
a
cat
(
sentence

6
).
Sentence

7
states
that
wolves
are
afraid
of
cats
.
Therefore
,
Win
ona
is
not
afraid
of
wolves
(
since
she
is
a
cat
).
However
,
the
question
does
not
ask
about
what
Win
ona
is
not
afraid
of
,
but
what
she
is
afraid
of
.
Since
there
is
no
information
provided
about
what
Win
ona
is
afraid
of
,
we
cannot
determine
a
specific
answer
.
