Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
mention
of
John
's
location
in
the
given
context
sentences
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
John
was
with
Mary
in
the
hallway
(
from
previous
context
).
Since
Mary
is
now
in
the
bedroom
(
from
sentence

4
),
it
is
likely
that
John
is
not
with
Mary
anymore
.
However
,
we
cannot
pinpoint
John
's
exact
location
.
