Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
before
the
office
,
which
is
this
morning
.
Since
there
is
no
mention
of
Mary
's
location
before
this
morning
,
we
can
infer
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
office
.
However
,
the
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
information
about
Mary
's
location
before
this
morning
.
