Reason
ing
:
Since
Bill
travelled
to
the
park
this
afternoon
,
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
park
.
There
is
no
information
about
Bill
's
whereabouts
before
this
afternoon
,
so
we
cannot
infer
a
specific
location
.
However
,
we
can
conclude
that
Bill
was
not
at
the
park
before
this
afternoon
.
