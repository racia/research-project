Reason
ing
:
Since
Sandra
and
Mary
went
back
to
the
kitchen
,
it
implies
that
Mary
was
previously
somewhere
else
.
John
and
Mary
travelled
to
the
hallway
,
which
means
John
was
with
Mary
in
the
hallway
.
Since
Mary
was
in
the
kitchen
earlier
,
it
's
likely
that
John
was
not
in
the
kitchen
.
Therefore
,
John
is
in
the
hallway
.
