Reason
ing
:
Since
Julie
went
to
the
office
this
morning
,
it
implies
that
she
was
not
in
the
office
before
this
morning
.
The
question
asks
about
where
she
was
before
the
office
,
which
means
we
need
to
find
out
where
she
was
before
going
to
the
office
.
The
only
information
we
have
is
that
she
went
to
the
office
this
morning
,
which
means
she
was
somewhere
else
before
coming
to
the
office
.
