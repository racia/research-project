Reason
ing
:
Sandra
is
mentioned
in
the
first
sentence
as
going
to
the
office
with
Mary
.
There
is
no
mention
of
her
leaving
the
office
or
going
anywhere
else
.
Therefore
,
it
is
inferred
that
Sandra
is
still
in
the
office
.
The
second
sentence
mentions
that
they
journey
ed
to
the
garden
,
which
implies
that
Sandra
is
no
longer
in
the
office
.
Since
the
question
asks
about
Sandra
's
current
location
,
it
is
inferred
that
Sandra
is
in
the
garden
.
