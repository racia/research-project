Reason
ing
:
According
to
sentence

7
,
Bill
went
back
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
.
Since
he
moved
to
the
kitchen
this
afternoon
,
it
is
logical
to
assume
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
kitchen
.
However
,
there
is
no
mention
of
Bill
's
activities
before
the
kitchen
in
the
given
context
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
where
Bill
was
before
the
park
.
