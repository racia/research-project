Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Bill
's
location
before
the
bedroom
,
but
the
context
sentences
do
not
mention
Bill
's
activity
before
the
bedroom
.
The
sentences
only
mention
Julie
's
movement
to
the
cinema
(
sentence

15
)
and
Fred
's
activity
at
the
park
yesterday
(
sentence

16
).
Since
the
question
is
asking
about
Bill
's
location
before
the
bedroom
,
which
is
not
mentioned
in
the
context
sentences
,
we
cannot
provide
an
answer
.

Not
