Reason
ing
:
John
and
Daniel
went
to
the
bathroom
,
and
then
they
went
back
to
the
kitchen
.
Since
Daniel
is
not
mentioned
as
leaving
the
bathroom
,
it
can
be
inferred
that
he
is
still
in
the
bathroom
or
has
moved
to
the
kitchen
with
John
.
Since
the
question
asks
about
Daniel
's
location
,
it
is
likely
that
he
is
in
the
bathroom
or
the
kitchen
,
as
he
is
not
mentioned
as
being
in
a
different
location
.

bathroom
