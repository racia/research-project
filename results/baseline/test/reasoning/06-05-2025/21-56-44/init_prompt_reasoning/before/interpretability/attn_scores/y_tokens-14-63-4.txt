:
The
question
asks
about
Julie
's
location
before
the
park
,
but
the
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
information
about
Julie
's
location
in
relation
to
the
park
.
However
,
sentence

9
states
that
Julie
went
back
to
the
park
this
morning
,
which
implies
that
Julie
was
somewhere
else
before
going
back
to
the
park

Since
there
is
no
information
provided
about
Julie
's
location
before
this
morning
,
we
cannot
determine
a
specific
location
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Julie
was
not
at
the
park
before
this
