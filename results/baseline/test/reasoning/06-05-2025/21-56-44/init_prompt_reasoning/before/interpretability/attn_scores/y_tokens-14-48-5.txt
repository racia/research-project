Reason
ing
:
The
question
is
asking
about
Bill
's
location
before
the
kitchen
,
but
the
context
sentences
only
mention
Fred
's
movements
,
not
Bill
's
.
Since
the
question
is
asking
about
Bill
,
we
need
to
go
back
to
the
previous
context
sentences
to
find
the
answer
.
However
,
Bill
's
location
is
not
mentioned
in
the
provided
context
sentences
.
Answer
:
not
mentioned
