Reason
ing
:
John
is
mentioned
in
the
first
sentence
as
going
to
the
garden
with
Sandra
.
There
is
no
mention
of
him
leaving
the
garden
or
going
anywhere
else
.
Therefore
,
it
is
inferred
that
John
is
still
in
the
garden
.
However
,
the
second
sentence
mentions
that
they
journey
ed
to
the
bedroom
,
which
implies
that
John
is
no
longer
in
the
garden
.
Since
John
and
Sandra
journey
ed
together
,
it
is
inferred
that
John
is
now
in
the
bedroom
.
