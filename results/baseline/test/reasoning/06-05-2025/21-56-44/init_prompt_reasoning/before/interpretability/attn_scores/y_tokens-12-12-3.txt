Reason
ing
:
Since
Sandra
and
Daniel
moved
to
the
office
together
,
it
implies
that
Daniel
is
currently
in
the
office
.
However
,
we
also
know
that
Daniel
and
John
journey
ed
to
the
hallway
together
,
which
means
Daniel
was
in
the
hallway
at
some
point
.
Since
the
question
asks
about
Daniel
's
current
location
,
we
can
infer
that
Daniel
is
currently
in
the
office
.
