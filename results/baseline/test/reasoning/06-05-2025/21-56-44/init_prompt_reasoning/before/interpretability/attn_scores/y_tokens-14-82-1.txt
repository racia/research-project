Reason
ing
:
Since
Julie
went
back
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
,
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
going

the
bedroom
.
The
only
other
information
we
have
about
Julie
's
location
is
that
she
went
back
to
the
office
yesterday
.

suggests
that
Julie
was
at
the
office
yesterday
,
and
before
going
back
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
.
