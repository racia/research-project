Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
moved
to
the
park
this
evening
(
sentence

15
),
and
there
is
no
information
about
her
whereabouts
before
that
,
we
can
infer
that
Mary
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
park
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Mary
was
not
at
the
school
,
as
Julie
went
back
to
the
school
this
morning
(
sentence

16
),
and
Mary
's
location
is
not
mentioned
in
relation
to
the
school
.
