Reason
ing
:
Since
Fred
travelled
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
,
and
yesterday
he
travelled
to
the
park
,
it
is
logical
to
assume
that
Fred
was
somewhere
before
he
travelled
to
the
bedroom
.
The
only
information
provided
about
Fred
's
previous
location
is
his
travel
to
the
park
yesterday
.
Therefore
,
it
is
reasonable
to
infer
that
Fred
was
in
the
park
before
he
travelled
to
the
bedroom
.
