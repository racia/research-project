Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
information
provided
about
Bill
's
location
before
going
to
the
kitchen
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Bill
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
kitchen
,
as
he
didn
't
go
to
the
kitchen
immediately
.
We
know
that
Bill
travelled
to
the
school
this
afternoon
(
sentence

13
),
but
we
don
't
know
where
he
was
before
that
.
