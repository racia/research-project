Reason
ing
:
Since
Fred
journey
ed
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
,
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
bedroom
.
The
only
information
we
have
about
Fred
's
previous
location
is
that
he
journey
ed
to
the
office
yesterday
(
sentence

4
).
This
suggests
that
Fred
was
not
at
the
office
this
morning
,
as
he
would
have
been
there
yesterday
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Fred
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
bedroom
.
