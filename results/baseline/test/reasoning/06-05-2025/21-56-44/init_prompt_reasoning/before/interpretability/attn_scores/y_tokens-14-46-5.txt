Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
information
provided
about
Mary
's
location

the
bedroom
.
The
sentences
only
mention
Bill

movement
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
,
and
Mary
's
movement
to
the
office
this
evening
,
but
not
her
location
before
that
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
Mary
's
location
before
the
bedroom
.
