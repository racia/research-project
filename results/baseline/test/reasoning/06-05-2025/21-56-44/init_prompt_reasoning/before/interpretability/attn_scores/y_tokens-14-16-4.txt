Reason
ing
:
The
question
is
asking
about
Bill
's
location
before
the
cinema
,
but
the
new
context
sentences
(
14
and

15
)
do
not
provide
any
information
about
Bill
's
location
.
The
previous
context
sentences
(
11
and

12
)
mentioned
Bill
's
location
before
the
cinema
,
which
was
the
office
.
Since
there
is
no
new
information
contradict
ing
this
,
we
can
stick
with
the
previous
answer
.
