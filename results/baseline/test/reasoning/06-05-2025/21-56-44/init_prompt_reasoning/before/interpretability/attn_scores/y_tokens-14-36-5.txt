Reason
ing
:
Since
Julie
went
to
the
school
this
evening
,
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
school
.
However
,
the
question
asks
about
the
bedroom
,
which
is
not
directly
related
to
Julie
's
movement
to
the
school
.
Since
Julie
went
to
the
cinema
this
afternoon
,
and
there
is
no
information
about
Julie
being
in
the
bedroom
,
we
cannot
infer
Julie
's
location
before
the
bedroom
.
