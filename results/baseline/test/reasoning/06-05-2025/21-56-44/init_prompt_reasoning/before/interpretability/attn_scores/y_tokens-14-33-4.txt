Reason
ing
:
Since
Julie
travelled
to
the
kitchen
this
afternoon
,
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
kitchen
.
The
context
sentence
does
not
specify
where
Julie
was
before
going
to
the
kitchen
,
but
it
does
not
mention
her
going
back
to
a
previous
location
either
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Julie
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
kitchen
.
