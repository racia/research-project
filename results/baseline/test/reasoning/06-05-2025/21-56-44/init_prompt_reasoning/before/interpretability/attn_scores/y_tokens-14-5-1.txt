Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
went
back
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
,
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
returning
to
the
kitchen
.
The
previous
sentence
tells
us
that
Mary
travelled
to
the
school
yesterday
,
which
means
she
was
at
the
school
yesterday
.
Since
she
went
back
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
,
it
's
likely
that
she
was
at
the
kitchen
before
going
to
the
school
yesterday
.
