Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
is
mentioned
in
both
sentences
,
and
she
is
going
to
or
travelling
to
a
location
with
someone
else
,
it
's
likely
that
she
is
in
a
location
with
the
person
she
is
with
.
In
sentence

10
,
she
is
going
to
the
bathroom
with
John
,
and
in
sentence

11
,
she
is
travelling
to
the
bedroom
with
Sandra
.
This
suggests
that
Mary
is
currently
in
the
bedroom
,
as
she
is
last
mentioned
there
.
