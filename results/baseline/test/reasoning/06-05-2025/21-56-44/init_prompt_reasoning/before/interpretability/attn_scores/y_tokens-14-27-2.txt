Reason
ing
:
Since
Julie
moved
to
the
bedroom
this
evening
,
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
bedroom
.
The
only
information
that
suggests
Julie
's
whereabouts
before
the
bedroom
is
sentence

1
,
which
is
not
provided
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Julie
was
not
at
the
cinema
,
as
Fred
went
back
to
the
cinema
yesterday
(
sentence

7
).
Therefore
,
Julie
's
whereabouts
before
the
bedroom
are
not
specified
.
Answer
:
not
mentioned
