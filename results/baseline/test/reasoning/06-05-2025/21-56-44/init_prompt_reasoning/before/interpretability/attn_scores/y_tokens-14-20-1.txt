Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
went
back
to
the
park
this
afternoon
,
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
going
back
to
the
park
.
The
only
information
we
have
about
Mary
's
previous
location
is
that
she
moved
to
the
office
this
morning
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Mary
was
in
the
office
before
going
back
to
the
park
.
