Reason
ing
:
Since
Sandra
is
present
in
both
sentences
,
it
implies
that
Sandra
is
the
common
entity
.
The
sentences
also
mention
Mary
and
Daniel
,
but
Sandra
is
the
one
who
is
moving
or
travelling
.
This
suggests
that
Sandra
is
the
central
figure
in
the
context
.
The
sentences
do
not
explicitly
mention
Mary
's
location
,
but
since
Sandra
is
in
the
bedroom
and
kitchen
,
it
is
likely
that
Mary
is
also
in
one
of
these
locations
.
Answer

kitchen
