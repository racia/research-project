Reason
ing
:
According
to
sentence

9
,
Julie
went
back
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
.
This
implies
that
Julie
was
somewhere
else
before
going
back
to
the
kitchen
.
The
context
sentences
do
not
provide
information
about
Julie
's
location
before
going
back
to
the
kitchen
.
However
,
there
is
no
mention
of
Julie
's
location
before
going
back
to
the
kitchen
,
so
we
cannot
infer
a
specific
location
.
