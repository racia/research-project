Reason
ing
:
The
previous
context
sentences
mentioned
that
John
and
Mary
went
back
to
the
bedroom
,
and
then
Daniel
and
Mary
moved
to
the
bathroom
.
However
,
the
latest
context
sentences
(
7
and

8
)
introduce
new
information
.
Since
John
is
not
mentioned
in
the
latest
sentences
,
we
can
infer
that
John
is
still
in
the
office
,
as
John
and
Daniel
journey
ed
to
the
office
.
Answer
:
office
