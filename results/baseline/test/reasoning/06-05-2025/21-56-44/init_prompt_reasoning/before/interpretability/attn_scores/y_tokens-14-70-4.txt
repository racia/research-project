Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
moved
to
the
cinema
this
evening
(
sentence

12
),
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
cinema
.
Since
she
moved
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
(
sentence

13
),
it
means
she
was
not
in
the
kitchen
before
yesterday
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
find
where
she
was
before
moving
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
.
