Reason
ing
:
Since
Sandra
and
Mary
went
back
to
the
kitchen
,
it
implies
that
they
were
previously
in
the
kitchen
.
Similarly
,
Daniel
and
John
moved
to
the

which
means
they
were
not
in
the
kitchen
initially
.
However
,
since
they
moved
to
the
kitchen
,
it
's
likely
that
they
are
currently
in
the
kitchen
.
