Reason
ing
:
Julie
moved
to
the
bedroom
this
afternoon
(
from
sentence

9
),
but
there
is
no
mention
of
her
going
to
the
office
.
Therefore
,
we

find
her
location
before
the

From
sentence

2
,
Julie
moved
to
the
office
this
morning
,
which
means
she
was
somewhere
else
before
that
.
However
,
we
don
't
have
any
information
about
her
location
before
the
office
,
so
we
cannot
pinpoint
a
specific
location
.
