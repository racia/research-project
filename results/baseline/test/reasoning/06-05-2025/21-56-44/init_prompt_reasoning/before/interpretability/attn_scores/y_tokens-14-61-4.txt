Reason
ing
:
Fred
went
back
to
the
cinema
this
afternoon
,
which
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
going
back
to
the
cinema
.
Since
there
is
no
information
about
his
previous
location
,
we
can
infer
that
he
was
at
home
or
in
a
different
location
,
but
not
at
the
park
(
because
Bill
moved
to
the
park
this
afternoon
,
not
Fred
).
