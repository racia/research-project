Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Fred
's
location
before
going

the
office
.
However
,
the
context
sentences
provided
do
not
mention
Fred
's
location
before
going
to
the
office
.
The
sentences
only
mention
Julie
's
location
,
which
is
the
kitchen
this
afternoon
and
the
cinema
this
morning
.
Since
Fred

is
not

,
we
cannot
determine
where
Fred
was
before
going
to
the
office
.
