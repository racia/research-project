Reason
ing
:
Since
John
is
mentioned
in
both
sentences
,
and
he
is
journey
ing
/tr
av
elling
with
different
people
(
Daniel
and
Sandra
)
to
different
locations
(
bed
room
and
kitchen
),
it
is
likely
that
John
is
present
in
both
places
.
However
,
the
question
asks
about
John
's
current
location
,
which
is
not
explicitly
stated
.
We
can
infer
that
John
is
likely
to
be
in
the
location
where
he
was
last
mentioned
,
which
is
the
kitchen
.
