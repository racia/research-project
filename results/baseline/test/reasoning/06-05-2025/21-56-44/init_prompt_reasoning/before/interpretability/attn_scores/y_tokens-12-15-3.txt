Reason
ing
:
According
to
sentence

7
,
Mary
and
Daniel
travelled
to
the
garden
together
.
Since
there
is
no
information
that
suggests
Daniel
left
the
garden
,
it
is
likely
that
Daniel
is
still
in
the
garden
.
However
,
sentence

8
mentions
that
Daniel
and
John
journey
ed
to
the
office
,
which
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
Daniel
is
not
in
the
office
as
well
.
Since
Daniel
and
John
travelled
together
,
it
is
possible
that
Daniel
is
in
the
office
.
