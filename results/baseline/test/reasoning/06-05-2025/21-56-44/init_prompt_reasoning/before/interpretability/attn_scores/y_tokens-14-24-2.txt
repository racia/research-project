Reason
ing
:
Since
Bill
moved
to
the
bedroom
this
afternoon
,
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
bedroom
.
Since
he
moved
to
the
bedroom
,
it
means
that
he
was
not
at
the
school
(
as
mentioned
in
sentence

7
)
before
moving
to
the
bedroom
.
The
only
other
place
mentioned
is
the
park
(
from
previous
context
),
but
it
's
not
specified
when
Bill
was
there
.
However
,
since
Bill
moved
to
the
bedroom
this
afternoon
,
it
's
likely
that
he
was
at
the
park
