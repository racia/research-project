Reason
ing
:
Since
John
and
Mary
went
to
the
office
in
sentence

1
,
and
Daniel
and
John
went
back
to
the
kitchen
in
sentence

2
,
it
implies
that
Mary
was
with
John
in
the
office
initially
.
However
,
since
John
went
back
to
the
kitchen
,
Mary
's
current
location
is
not
explicitly
mentioned
.
We
can
infer
that
Mary
is
still
in
the
office
,
as
there
is
no
indication
that
she
left
the
office
with
John
.
