Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Bill
's
location
before
going
back
to
the
school
.
Since
Bill
travelled
to
the
bedroom
yesterday
,
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
that
.
Bill
went
back
to
the
school
this
morning
,
which
means
he
was
not
at
the
school
yesterday
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
find
out
where
Bill
was
yesterday
.
Answer
:
bedroom
