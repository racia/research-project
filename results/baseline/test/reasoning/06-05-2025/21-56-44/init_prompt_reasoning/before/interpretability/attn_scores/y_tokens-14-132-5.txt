Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Bill
's
location
before
the
park
,
but
the
context
sentences
do
not
mention
Bill
going
to
the
park
.
The
context
sentence
"
Bill
went
back
to
the
office
this
afternoon
"
suggests
that
Bill
was
somewhere
else
before
going
back
to
the
office
.
However
,
there
is
no
information
about
Bill
's
location
before
going
to
the
office
,
which
is
not
the
same
as
the
park
.
Answer
