Reason
ing
:
Since
Fred
went
to
the
bedroom
this
evening
(
sentence

13
),
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
bedroom
.
The
only
information
provided
about
Fred
's
previous
location
is
that
he
went
back
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
(
sentence

4
from
the
previous
task
).
However
,
this
information
is
not
relevant
to
the
current
question
,
which
asks
about
Fred
's
location
before
going
to
the
bedroom
.
Since
the
question
does
not
provide
any
information
about
Fred
's
location
before
the
bedroom
,
the
answer
