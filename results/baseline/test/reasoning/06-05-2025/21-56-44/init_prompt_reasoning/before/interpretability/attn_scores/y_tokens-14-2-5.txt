Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Julie
's
location
before
going
to
the
office
.
However
,
the
context
sentences
do
not
mention
Julie
going
to
the
office
.
Instead
,
Julie
went
to
the
kitchen
this
afternoon
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
find
out
where
Julie
was
before
going
to
the
kitchen
.
Answer
:
office
(
since
Julie
travelled
to
the
office
this
morning
)
