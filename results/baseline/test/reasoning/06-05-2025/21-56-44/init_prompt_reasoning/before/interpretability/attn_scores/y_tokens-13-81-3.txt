Reason
ing
:
Sandra
is
mentioned
in
the
first
sentence
as
going
back
to
the
kitchen
with
Daniel
.
There
is
no
mention
of
her
leaving
the
kitchen
or
going
anywhere
else
.
Therefore
,
it
is
inferred
that
Sandra
is
still
in
the
kitchen
.
The
second
sentence
mentions
that
they
travelled
to
the
office
,
but
since
Sandra
is
still
in
the
kitchen
,
it
is
inferred
that
she
is
not
in
the
office
.
