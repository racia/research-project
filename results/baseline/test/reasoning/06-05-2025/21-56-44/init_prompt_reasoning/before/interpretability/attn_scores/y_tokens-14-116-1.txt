Reason
ing
:
Since
Fred
journey
ed
to
the
school
this
morning
,
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
arriving
at
the
school
.
The
only
information
provided
about
Fred
's
previous
location
is
that
he
travelled
to
the
park
yesterday
.
However
,
this
information
does
not
directly
answer
the
question
about
his
location
before
arriving
at
the
school
.
We
need
to
infer
his
location
before
the
school
.
Answer
