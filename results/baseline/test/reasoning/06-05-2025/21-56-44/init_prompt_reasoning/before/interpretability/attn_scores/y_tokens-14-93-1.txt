Reason
ing
:
Julie
journey
ed
to
the
park
yesterday
,
which
means
she
was
somewhere
else
before
going
to
the
park
.
Then
,
she
moved
to
the
office
this
morning
,
which
implies
that
she
was
not
at
the
office
before
moving
to
it
.
Since
Julie
was
not
at
the
office
before
moving
to
it
,
we
need
to
find
where
she
was
before
moving
to
the
office
.
The
only
other
information
we
have
is
that
Julie
journey
ed
to
the
park
yesterday
,
which
means
she
was
at
the
park
yesterday
.
Therefore
