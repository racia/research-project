Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Julie
's
location
before
the
park
,
but
the
context
sentences
provided
do
not
mention
Julie
's
location
before
the
park
.
The
sentences
only
mention
Fred
's
location
(
bed
room
)
and
Mary
's
location
(
park
),
but
not
Julie
's
.
Since
Julie
's
location
is
not
mentioned
,
we
cannot
determine
where
Julie
was
before
the
park
.
Answer
:
not
mentioned
