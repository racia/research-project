Reason
ing
:
Since
Fred
moved
to
the
kitchen
this
afternoon
,
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
kitchen
.
The
only
other
place
mentioned
where
Fred
was
previously
is
the
park
,
which
he
went
back
to
this
evening
.
However
,
this
information
is
about
his
evening
activity
,
not
his
afternoon
activity
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
consider
the
context
sentences
before
this
one
.
