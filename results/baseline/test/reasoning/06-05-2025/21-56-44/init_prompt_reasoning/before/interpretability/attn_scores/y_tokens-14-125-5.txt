Reason
ing
:
The
new
information
is
that
Bill
moved
to
the
cinema
this
afternoon
(
from
sentence

17
).
However
,
this
doesn
't
change
the
previous
information
that
Bill
travelled
to
the
school
this
morning
(
from
sentence

15
).
The
question
asks
about
the
location
before
the
school
,
so
we
can
still
answer
that
Bill
was
not
mentioned
before
going
to
the
school
.
Answer
:
not
mentioned
