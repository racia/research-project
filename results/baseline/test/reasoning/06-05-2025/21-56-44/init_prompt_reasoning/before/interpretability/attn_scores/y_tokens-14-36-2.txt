Reason
ing
:
Since
Fred
moved
to
the
school
this
evening
,
it
implies
that
he
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
school
.
However
,
the
question
asks
about
the
bedroom
,
which
is
not
directly
related
to
Fred
's
movement
to
the
school
.
Since
Bill
journey
ed
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
,
and
there
is
no
information
about
Fred
being
in
the
bedroom
,
we
cannot
infer
Fred
's
location
before
the
bedroom
.
