Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
before
the
park
,
but
the
context
sentences
provided
do
not
mention
Mary
's
location
before
the
park
.
The
sentences
only
mention
Fred

locations
,
which
are
the
cinema
and
the
kitchen
.
Since
Mary
is
not
mentioned
in

provided
context
,
we
cannot
determine
her
location
before
the
park
.
