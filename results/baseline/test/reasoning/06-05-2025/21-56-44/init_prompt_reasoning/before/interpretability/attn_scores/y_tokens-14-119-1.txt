Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
went
back
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
,
it
implies
that
she
was
somewhere
else
before
coming
to
the
kitchen
.
The
only
previous
mention
of
Mary
's
location
is
in
sentence

1
,
where
it
is
mentioned
that
she
went
back
to
the
bedroom
yesterday
.
This
suggests
that
Mary
was
in
the
bedroom
yesterday
,
and
it
is
likely
that
she
returned
to
the
bedroom
before
coming
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
.
