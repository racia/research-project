Reason
ing
:
Mary
and
Daniel
went
back
to
the
hallway
,
and
then
they
moved
to
the
kitchen
.
Since
Mary
is
not
mentioned
as
leaving
the
hallway
,
it
can
be
inferred
that
she
is
still
in
the
hallway
or
has
moved
to
the
kitchen
with
Daniel
.
Since
the
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
,
it
is
likely
that
she
is
in
the
kitchen
,
as
she
is
not
mentioned
as
being
in
the
hallway
anymore
.
