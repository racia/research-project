Here are the context sentences:
1. Daniel and John journeyed to the bedroom.
2. Sandra and John travelled to the kitchen.

Now, answer the following question:
Where is John?"	kitchen	from the context sentences, we know that john was involved in two separate journeys: one with daniel to the bedroom (sentence 1) and another with sandra to the kitchen (sentence 2). since the question asks about john's current location, we need to determine which journey is more recent. sentence 2 is the most recent information provided about john's movement, indicating that he travelled to the kitchen with sandra. therefore, john's current location is the kitchen.	fully	kitchen	True	Since John is mentioned in both sentences, and he is journeying/travelling with different people (Daniel and Sandra) to different locations (bedroom and kitchen), it is likely that John is present in both places. However, the question asks about John's current location, which is not explicitly stated. We can infer that John is likely to be in the location where he was last mentioned, which is the kitchen.
