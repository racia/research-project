Reason
ing
:
The
football
is
mentioned
only
in
sentence

9
,
where
Sandra
grabbed
it
,
and
there
is
no
mention
of
where
she
put
it
down
or
what
happened
to
it
after
that
.
However
,
since
Sandra
went
to
the
hallway
(
sentence

11
)
and
then
back
to
the
bathroom
(
sentence

12
),
it
is
likely
that
the
football
is
still
with
Sandra
,
possibly
in
the
bathroom
.
Answer

bathroom
