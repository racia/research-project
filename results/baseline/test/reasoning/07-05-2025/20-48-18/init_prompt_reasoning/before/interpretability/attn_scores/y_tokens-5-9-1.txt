Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
explicitly
state
who
gave
the
milk
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Fred
grabbed
the
milk
in
sentence

6
,
and
Jeff
picked
up
the
milk
in
sentences

13
and

21
.
Additionally
,
Jeff
dropped
the
milk
in
sentences

20
and

24
,
and
then
grabbed
it
again
in
sentence

25
.
This
suggests
that
Jeff
was
handling
the
milk
multiple
times
,
but
it
does
not
indicate
who
initially
gave
the
milk
.
