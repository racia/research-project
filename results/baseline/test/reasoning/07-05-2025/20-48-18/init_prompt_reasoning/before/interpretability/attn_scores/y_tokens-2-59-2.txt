Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
mention
Daniel
dropping
the
apple
,
but
they
don
't
specify
where
he
dropped
it
.
However
,
the
previous
context
sentences
mentioned
Daniel
taking
the
apple
in
the
kitchen
(
sentence

9
).
Since
there
is
no
mention
of
him
moving
the
apple
or
dropping
it
anywhere
else
,
it
is
likely
that
the
apple
is
still
in
the
kitchen
.
Answer
:
kitchen
