ing
:
Since
John
got
the
football
"
there
",
and
John

to
the
hallway
,
it
is
likely
that
"
there
"
refers
to
the
location
where
John
got
the
football
,
which
is
not
specified

However
,
we
can
infer
that
John
went
to
the
hallway
,

means
that
the
location
where
he
got
the
football
is
likely
to
be
the
same
as
the
hallway
