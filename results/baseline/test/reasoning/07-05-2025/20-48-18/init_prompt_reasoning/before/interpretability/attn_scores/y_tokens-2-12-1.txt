Reason
ing
:
The
apple
was
grabbed
by
John
in
the
bathroom
(
sentence

10
),
and
then
discarded
by
John
(
sentence

14
).
Since
John
discarded
the
apple
,
it
is
likely
that
the
apple
is
no
longer
in
the
bathroom
.
However
,
there
is
no
mention
of
the
apple
being
moved
to
another
location
.
Therefore
,
the
most
likely
answer
is
that
the
apple
is
still
in
the
bathroom
.
Answer
:
bathroom
