Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
discarded
the
milk
,
it
is
likely
that
the
milk
is
no
longer
in
the
location
where
Mary
got
it
,
which
is
not
specified
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Mary
travelled
to
the
hallway
(
from
previous
context
),
which
means
that
the
milk
is
not
in
the
hallway
.
Since
the
milk
is
discarded
,
it
is
likely
to
be
in
a
location
where
it
was
discarded
,
which
is
not
specified
.
