Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
what
is
west
of
the
bedroom
.
According
to
sentence

2
,
the
hallway
is
west
of
the
bedroom
.
However
,
the
question
does
not
ask
what
is
west
of
the
hallway
,
but
rather
what
is
west
of
the
bedroom
.
Since
the
kitchen
is
east
of
the
bedroom
(
sentence

1
),
it
cannot
be
west
of
the
bedroom
.
Therefore
,
the
answer
is
not
the
kitchen
.
Answer
:
None
