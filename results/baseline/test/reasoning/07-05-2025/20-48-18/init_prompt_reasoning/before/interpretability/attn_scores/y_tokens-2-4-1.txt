Reason
ing
:
The
milk
was
grabbed
by
Mary
in
the
office
(
sentence

9
),
and
then
dropped
by
Mary
(
sentence

15
).
Since
Mary
dropped
the
milk
,
it
is
likely
that
the
milk
is
on
the
floor
or
in
the
garden
,
where
Mary
travelled
to
after
grabbing
the
milk
.
However
,
the
exact
location
of
the
milk
is
not
specified
,
so
we
cannot
pinpoint
an
exact
location
.
Answer
:
garden
