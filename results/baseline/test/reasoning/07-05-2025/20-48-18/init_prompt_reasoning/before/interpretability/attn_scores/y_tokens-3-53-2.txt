Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
mention
the
milk
being
in
the
garden
before
Daniel
journey
ed
to
the
garden
.
The
only
mention
of
the
milk
is
in
sentence

13
,
where
Daniel
left
it
.
Since
Daniel
journey
ed
to
the
garden
,
it
is
likely
that
he
took
the
milk
with
him
.
However
,
the
context
sentences
do
not
provide
information
about
where
the
milk
was
before
Daniel
left
it
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
the
exact
location
of
the
milk
before
the
garden
.
