Reason
ing
:
The
football
was
discarded
by
Mary
,
and
its
current
location
is
not
specified
.
However
,
in
the
previous
context
,
it
was
mentioned
that
Mary
discarded
the
football
,
and
it
was
not
specified
where
she
discarded
it
.
Since
Sandra
moved
to
the
hallway
,
it
can
be
inferred
that
the
football
is
still
in
the
hallway
,
as
there
is
no
indication
that
it
was
moved
to
a
different
location
.
