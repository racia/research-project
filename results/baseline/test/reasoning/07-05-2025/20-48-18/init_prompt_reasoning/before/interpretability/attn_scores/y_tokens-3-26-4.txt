Reason
ing
:
The
apple
was
dropped
by
Daniel
(
sentence

42
),
and
then
Daniel
moved
to
the
kitchen
(
sentence

39
).
Since
the
apple
was
dropped
,
it
was
not
in
the
kitchen
before
Daniel
moved
there
.
The
sentence
before
the
drop
doesn
't
mention
the
apple
's
location
,
so
we
can
't
infer
where
it
was
before
the
kitchen
.
