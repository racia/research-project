Reason
ing
:
Since
the
hallway
is
south
of
the
garden
,
and
there
is
no
information
about
the
garden
's
location
in
relation
to
the
hallway
,
we
can
infer
that
the
hallway
is
not
north
of
the
garden
.
However
,
the
hallway
is
south
of
the
bedroom
,
and
there
is
no
information
about
the
bedroom
's
location
in
relation
to
the
hallway
.
Therefore
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
hallway
is
not
north
of
the
bedroom
either
.
