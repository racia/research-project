Reason
ing
:
Mary
went
back
to
the
office
,
which
implies
that
she
was
previously
somewhere
else
,
but
the
context
doesn
't
provide
information
about
where
she
was
before
going
back
to
the
office
.
However
,
it
doesn
't
mention
her
leaving
the
office
,
so
it
's
likely
that
she
is
still
in
the
office
.
