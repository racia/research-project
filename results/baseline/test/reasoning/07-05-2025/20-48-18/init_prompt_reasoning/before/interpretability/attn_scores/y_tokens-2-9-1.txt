Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
mention
John
getting
the
milk
twice
,
and
putting
it
down
once
.
This
implies
that
the
milk
is
not
with
John
anymore
,
and
it
was
likely
put
down
in
the
same
location
where
John
got
it
.
Since
John
got
the
milk
in
the
kitchen
(
sentence

3
),
it
is
likely
that
the
milk
is
still
in
the
kitchen
.
Answer
:
kitchen
