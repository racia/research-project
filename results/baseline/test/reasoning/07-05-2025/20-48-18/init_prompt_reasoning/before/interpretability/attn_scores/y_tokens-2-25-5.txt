Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
indicate
that
John
dropped
the
football
,
which
means
he
let
it
fall
.
Since
there
is
no
mention
of
the
football
being
moved
to
a
specific
location
,
it
can
be
inferred
that
the
football
is
still
in
the
location
where
John
dropped
it
.
The
only
location
mentioned
after
John
dropped
the
football
is
the
hallway
,
where
Daniel
and
Mary
went
,
but
there
is
no
connection
between
John
and
the
hallway
.
Therefore
,
the
football
is
likely
still
in
the
location
where
John
dropped
it
.
