Reason
ing
:
The
football
was
previously
mentioned
in
sentence

4
as
being
grabbed
by
Daniel
in
the
hallway
.
However
,
in
sentence

9
,
it
is
stated
that
Daniel
discarded
the
football
,
which
implies
that
the
football
is
no
longer
in
the
hallway
.
Since
there
is
no
mention
of
the
football
being
moved
to
the
kitchen
,
it
is
likely
that
the
football
is
no
longer
present
in
any
of
the
locations
mentioned
.
