Reason
ing
:
The
question
is
asking
about
the
milk
's
location
before
the
kitchen
,
but
the
context
sentences
provided
do
not
mention
the
milk
at
all
.
The
sentences
only
mention
the
football
,
and
there
is
no
connection
between
the
football
and
the
milk
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
the
milk
's
location
before
the
kitchen
based
on
these
sentences
.
