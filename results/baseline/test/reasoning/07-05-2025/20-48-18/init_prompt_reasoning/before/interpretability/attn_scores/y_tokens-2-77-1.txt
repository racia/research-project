Reason
ing
:
Sandra
discarded
the
football
,
which
means
it
was
previously
grabbed
by
Sandra
.
Since
Sandra
grabbed
the
football
twice
,
it
's
likely
that
the
football
was
with
Sandra
.
However
,
Sandra
went
to
the
bathroom
,
which
is
not
the
same
location
as
the
office
where
Daniel
travelled
.
This
suggests
that
the
football
is
not
in
the
office
.
