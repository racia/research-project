Reason
ing
:
Since
the
football
was
previously
put
down
,
and
John
went
to
the
kitchen
,
it
is
likely
that
the
football
is
still
in
the
location
where
John
put
it
down
,
which
is
not
specified
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
John
went
to
the
kitchen
,
and
Sandra
travelled
to
the
hallway
,
which
means
that
the
football
is
not
in
the
hallway
.
Therefore
,
the
football
is
likely
to
be
in
the
kitchen
,
where
John
went
.
