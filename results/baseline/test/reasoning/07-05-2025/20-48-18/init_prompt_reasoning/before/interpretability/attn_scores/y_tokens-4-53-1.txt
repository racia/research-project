Reason
ing
:
Since
the
hallway
is
south
of
the
bedroom
,
and
the
bedroom
is
south
of
the
garden
,
it
implies
that
the
hallway
is
north
of
the
garden
.
However
,
the
question
asks
what
is
the
bedroom
north
of
,
which
is
not
directly
mentioned
in
the
context
sentences
.
We
can
infer
that
the
bedroom
is
not
north
of
anything
,
as
it
is
south
of
the
hallway
and
the
garden
.
