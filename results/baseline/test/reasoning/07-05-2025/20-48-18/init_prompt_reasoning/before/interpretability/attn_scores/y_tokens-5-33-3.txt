Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
what
Fred
gave
to
Bill
,
but
the
context
sentences
do
not
mention
Fred
giving
anything
to
Bill
.
In
fact
,
sentence

11
states
that
Fred
gave
the
apple
to
Bill
,
but
sentence

14
states
that
Bill
discarded
the
apple
,
which
means
the
apple
is
no
longer
with
Bill
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
what
Fred
gave
to
Bill
.
Answer

Not
