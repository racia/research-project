I
apologize
for
the
mistake
.
The
current
context
sentences
do
not
mention
the
milk
at
all
.
The
previous
question
(
Where
was
the
milk
before
the
garden
?)
was
answered
based
on
the
context
sentences

40
-
49
,
and
the
answer
remains
the
same
:
bathroom
.
However
,
the
current
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
the
milk
's
location
,
so
the
answer
remains
the
same
:
bathroom
.
