Reason
ing
:
The
milk
was
taken
by
Sandra
in
sentence

65
,
and
then
put
down
in
sentence

71
.
After
that
,
it
was
taken
again
in
sentence

72
,
and
then
discarded
in
sentence

81
.
Since
the
question
asks
about
the
milk
before
the
bathroom
,
we
need
to
look
at
the
events
before
Sandra
journey
ed
to
the
bathroom
in
sentence

80
.
The
last
event
before
that
was
Sandra
moving
to
the
hallway
in
sentence

79
,
but
that
's
not
relevant
to
the
milk
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
look
at
the
event
before
that
,
which
is
Sandra
putting
down
the
milk
in
sentence

71
.
So
,
the
milk
was
on
the
floor
before
the
bathroom
.
Answer
:
floor
