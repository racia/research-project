Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
location
of
the
football
before
the
hallway
.
We
can
infer
that
the
football
was
in
the
office
because
Sandra
took
the
football
(
sentence

46
)
and
then
travelled
to
the
hallway
(
sentence

50
).
However
,
before
that
,
the
football
was
dropped
(
sentence

51
),
which
implies
that
it
was
in
the
bathroom
.
Since
Sandra
dropped
the
football
,
it
was
likely
in
the
bathroom
before
the
hallway
.
Answer

bathroom
