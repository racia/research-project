Reason
ing
:
Since
Sandra
got
the
football
"
there
",
and
John
went
to
the
kitchen
,
it
is
likely
that
"
there
"
refers
to
the
kitchen
.
Sandra
went
back
to
the
kitchen
and
then
to
the
bathroom
,
but
there
is
no
mention
of
her
going
to
the
hallway
or
the
bedroom
.
Therefore
,
the
most
likely
location
of
the
football
is
the
kitchen
.

kitchen
