Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
mention
Daniel
leaving
the
apple
,
but
there
is
no
mention
of
where
he
left
it
.
However
,
John
travelled
to
the
hallway
,
which
implies
that
the
apple
is
not
in
the
hallway
,
as
John
didn
't
bring
it
there
.
Therefore
,
the
apple
must
be
somewhere
else
,
possibly
where
Daniel
left
it
.
