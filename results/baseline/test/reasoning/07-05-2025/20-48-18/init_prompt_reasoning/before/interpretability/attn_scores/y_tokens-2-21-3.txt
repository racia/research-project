Reason
ing
:
Daniel
picked
up
the
milk
,
but
the
location
where
he
picked
it
up
is
not
specified
.
However
,
the
previous
question
about
the
milk
's
location
was
answered
,
and
it
was
in
the
office
.
Since
Daniel
picked
up
the
milk
,
it
's
likely
that
the
milk
is
now
with
Daniel
,
and
since
Daniel
travelled
to
the
kitchen
,
the
milk
is
likely
in
the
kitchen
.
