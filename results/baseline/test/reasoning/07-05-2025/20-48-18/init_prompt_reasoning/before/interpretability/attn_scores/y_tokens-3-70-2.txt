Reason
ing
:
The
milk
was
taken
by
Sandra
in
sentence

46
.
Before
that
,
the
milk
was
dropped
by
Mary
in
sentence

43
.
Since
the
question
asks
about
the
milk
before
the
garden
,
we
need
to
look
at
the
events
before
Sandra
journey
ed
to
the
garden
in
sentence

48
.
The
last
event
before
that
was
Sandra
putting
down
the
milk
in
sentence

49
,
but
that
's
after
she
journey
ed
to
the
garden
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
look
at
the
event
before
that
,
which
is
Sandra
taking
the
milk
in
sentence

46
.
So
,
the
milk
was
taken
by
Sandra
before
the
garden
.
