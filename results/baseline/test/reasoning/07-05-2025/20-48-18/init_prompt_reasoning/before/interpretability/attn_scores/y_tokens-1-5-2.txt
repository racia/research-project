Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
only
mention
Sandra
moving
to
the
office
and
John
journey
ing
to
the
office
.
There
is
no
information
about
John
's
current
location
after
his
journey
.
Since
the
question
asks
about
John
's
current
location
,
we
can
only
infer
that
he
is
likely
to
be
in
the
office
,
but
we
cannot
confirm
it
with
certainty
.
