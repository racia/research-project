Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
provide
two
locations
where
Mary
has
been
:
the
garden
and
the
office
.
Since
the
question
asks
about
Mary
's
current
location
,
we
need
to
consider
both
possibilities
.
However
,
there
is
no
information
that
suggests
Mary
has
moved
from
one
location
to
the
other
,
so
we
can
't
infer
her
current
location
based
on
the
previous
actions
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
consider
both
locations
as
possibilities
.
