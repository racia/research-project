Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
milk
's
location
before
it
was
in
the
kitchen
.
Since
Daniel
picked
up
the
milk
in
the
kitchen
(
sentence

5
),
it
implies
that
the
milk
was
not
in
the
kitchen
before
Daniel
picked
it
up
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
find
the
location
where
Daniel
picked
up
the
milk
.
According
to
sentence

5
,
Daniel
picked
up
the
milk
"
there
",
which
refers
to
the
location
mentioned
in
sentence

4
,
which
is
the
kitchen
.
However
,
this
is
not
the
location
where
the
milk
was
before
.
To
find
the
location
,
we
need
to
look
for
the
sentence
where
the
milk
is
mentioned
before
sentence

4
.
Sentence

2
mentions
John
going
to
the
hallway
,
but
it
does
not
mention
the
milk
.
