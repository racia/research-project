Reason
ing
:
The
apple
was
picked
up
by
Mary
,
and
then
Mary
moved
to
the
office
.
Since
the
apple
was
picked
up
before
Mary
moved
to
the
office
,
it
was
not
in
the
office
initially
.
The
context
sentences
do
not
mention
where
the
apple
was
before
Mary
picked
it
up
,
so
we
cannot
determine
its
exact
location
before
the
office
.
