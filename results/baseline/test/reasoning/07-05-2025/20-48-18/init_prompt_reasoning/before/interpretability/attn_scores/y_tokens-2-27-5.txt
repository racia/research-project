Reason
ing
:
The
football
was
last
mentioned
being
grabbed
by
Sandra
(
sentence

25
),
but
the
location
is
not
specified
.
However
,
we
know
that
Sandra
discarded
the
football
(
sentence

29
),
which
means
it
is
no
longer
in
the
location
where
she
grabbed
it
.
Since
there
is
no
mention
of
the
football
being
moved
to
a
specific
location
,
it
is
likely
that
the
football
is
still
in
the
same
location
where
Sandra
discarded
it
.
