Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
mention
of
the
office
in
these
context
sentences
.
The
sentences
only
mention
Mary
dropping
the
milk
and
Daniel
taking
the
football
.
Additionally
,
the
previous
context
sentences
mentioned
Mary
picking
up
the
milk
,
but
not
taking
it
to
the
office
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
where
the
milk
was
before
the
office
.
