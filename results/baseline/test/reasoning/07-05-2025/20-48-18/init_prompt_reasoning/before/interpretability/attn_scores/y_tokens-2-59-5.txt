Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
mention
John
putting
down
the
milk
,
but
they
don
't
specify
where
he
put
it
.
However
,
the
previous
context
sentence
mentioned
John
picking
up
the
milk
in
the
bedroom
(
sentence

8
).
Since
there
is
no
mention
of
him
moving
the
milk
or
putting
it
anywhere
else
,
it
is
likely
that
the
milk
is
still
in
the
bedroom
.
Answer
:
bedroom
