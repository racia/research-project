Reason
ing
:
The
milk
was
taken
by
Mary
in
sentence

33
,
but
there
is
no
mention
of
where
it
was
before
that
.
However
,
in
sentence

41
,
Mary
discarded
the
milk
,
which
implies
that
she
had
the
milk
with
her
before
disc
arding
it
.
Since
Mary
went
to
the
bedroom
in
sentence

40
,
it
can
be
inferred
that
the
milk
was
with
Mary
before
she
went
to
the
bedroom
.
Answer
:

Mary
