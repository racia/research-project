Reason
ing
:
The
apple
was
initially
obtained
by
Mary
(
sentence

2
).
Then
,
Sandra
grabbed
the
apple
(
sentence

10
).
After
that
,
Sandra
discarded
the
apple
(
sentence

13
),
and
then
got
the
apple
again
(
sentence

14
).
Since
the
question
asks
about
the
apple
before
the
office
,
we
need
to
find
the
apple
's
location
before
Sandra
travelled
to
the
office
(
sentence

4
).
Since
Sandra
got
the
apple
again
after
disc
arding
it
,
the
apple
was
with
Sandra
before
she
travelled
to
the
office
.
