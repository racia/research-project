Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
mention
Daniel
putting
down
the
football
,
but
the
location
mentioned
is
not
specified
.
However
,
earlier
sentences
(
1
-
2
)
mention
John
travelling
to
the
office
and
then
to
the
garden
,
and
Mary
getting
the
football
in
the
garden
.
Since
there
is
no
mention
of
the
football
being
moved
from
the
garden
,
it
is
likely
that
the
football
is
still
in
the
garden
.
Answer

garden
