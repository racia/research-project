Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
what
is
the
bedroom
west
of
.
From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
hallway
is
west
of
the
bedroom
.
However
,
the
question
is
asking
what
the
bedroom
is
west
of
,
not
what
is
west
of
the
bedroom
.
Since
the
question
is
asking
about
the
bedroom
,
we
need
to
look
at
sentence

1
,
which
states
the
kitchen
is
east
of
the
bedroom
.
This
implies
that
the
bedroom
is
not
west
of
anything
,
as
it
is
being
described
as
having
something
(
the
kitchen
)
east
of
it
.
Answer
:
nothing
