Reason
ing
:
The
football
was
previously
mentioned
in
sentence

9
,
where
Sandra
grabbed
it
,
and
then
in
sentence

12
,
where
she
went
back
to
the
bathroom
.
However
,
in
sentence

14
,
it
is
mentioned
that
Sandra
discarded
the
football
,
which
implies
that
the
football
is
no
longer
with
Sandra
.
Since
there
is
no
mention
of
where
Sandra
discarded
the
football
,
it
is
possible
that
it
was
discarded
in
the
bathroom
,
where
Sandra
was
last
seen
.
