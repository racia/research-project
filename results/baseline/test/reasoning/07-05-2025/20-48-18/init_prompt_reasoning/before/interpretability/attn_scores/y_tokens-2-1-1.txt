Reason
ing
:
Since
Mary
got
the
milk
"
there
",
and
John
moved
to
the
bedroom
,
it
is
likely
that
"
there
"
refers
to
the
location
where
Mary
got
the
milk
,
which
is
not
specified
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Mary
travelled
to
the
hallway
,
which
means
that
the
location
where
she
got
the
milk
is
not
the
hallway
.
Therefore
,
the
milk
is
likely
to
be
in
the
kitchen
,
where
Sandra
went
back
to
.
Answer

kitchen
