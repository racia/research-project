Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
mention
that
Daniel
grabbed
the
football
in
the
bedroom
and
then
discarded
it
.
There
is
no
mention
of
the
football
being
moved
or
left
anywhere
else
.
Therefore
,
it
is
likely
that
the
football
is
no
longer
in
the
bedroom
,
but
rather
it
has
been
discarded
,
which
implies
that
it
is
not
in
any
specific
location
.
Answer
:
not
in
any
specific
location
