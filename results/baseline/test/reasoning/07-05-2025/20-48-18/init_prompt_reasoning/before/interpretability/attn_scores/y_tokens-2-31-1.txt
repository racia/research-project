Reason
ing
:
The
apple
was
grabbed
by
Sandra
in
the
bedroom
,
and
then
left
by
Sandra
.
Since
Daniel
travelled
to
the
kitchen
,
it
is
likely
that
Sandra
left
the
apple
somewhere
before
going
to
the
kitchen
.
The
only
place
mentioned
where
Sandra
was
before
going
to
the
kitchen
is
the
bedroom
,
so
it
is
likely
that
the
apple
is
still
in
the
bedroom
.
