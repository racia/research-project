Reason
ing
:
The
apple
is
not
mentioned
before
sentence

75
,
where
Mary
put
down
the
apple
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
apple
was
in
the
hallway
before
Mary
put
it
down
,
since
Sandra
took
the
milk
in
sentence

71
and
discarded
it
in
sentence

73
,
which
suggests
that
the
milk
was
in
the
hallway
before
Sandra
took
it
.
