Reason
ing
:
The
football
was
last
mentioned
being
picked
up
by
Sandra
in
the
hallway
(
sentence

16
).
After
that
,
Sandra
discarded
the
football
(
sentence

23
),
which
means
it
is
no
longer
in
the
hallway
.
Since
there
is
no
mention
of
the
football
being
moved
to
a
specific
location
,
it
is
likely
that
the
football
is
still
in
the
hallway
,
but
discarded
.
