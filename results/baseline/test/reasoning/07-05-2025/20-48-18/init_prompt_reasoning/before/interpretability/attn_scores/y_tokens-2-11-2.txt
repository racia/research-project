Reason
ing
:
Since
John
grabbed
the
apple
"
there
",
and
Daniel
took
the
milk
"
there
",
it
is
likely
that
"
there
"
refers
to
the
same
location
.
However
,
Daniel
dropped
the
milk
,
which
suggests
that
the
location
is
not
the
kitchen
,
where
Sandra
journey
ed
to
.
Sandra
went
back
to
the
garden
,
but
there
is
no
mention
of
John
going
to
the
garden
.
Therefore
,
the
most
likely
location
of
the
apple
is
the
hallway
,
where
John
went
.
Answer
:
hallway
