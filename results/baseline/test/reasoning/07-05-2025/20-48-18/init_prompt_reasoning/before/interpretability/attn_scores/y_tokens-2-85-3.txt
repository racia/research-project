Reason
ing
:
The
apple
was
picked
up
by
John
(
sentence

15
),
then
put
down
(
sentence

19
),
and
then
grabbed
again
(
sentence

20
).
Finally
,
John
left
the
apple
there
(
sentence

21
).
Since
John
left
the
apple
there
,
it
is
likely
that
he
left
it
in
the
same
place
where
he
put
it
down
,
which
is
not
specified
.
However
,
based
on
the
previous
context
,
it
is
likely
that
the
apple
is
in
the
kitchen
,
where
John
put
it
down
initially
.
Answer

kitchen
