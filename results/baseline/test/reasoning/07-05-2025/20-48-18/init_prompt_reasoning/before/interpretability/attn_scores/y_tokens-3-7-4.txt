Reason
ing
:
The
milk
was
last
mentioned
in
sentence

14
,
where
John
took
the
milk
.
Since
John
then
put
down
the
milk
in
the
hallway
(
sentence

37
),
it
can
be
inferred
that
the
milk
was
in
the
hallway
before
John
put
it
down
.
However
,
the
question
asks
about
the
milk
before
the
bedroom
,
which
is
not
directly
related
to
the
hallway
.
Since
there
is
no
mention
of
the
milk
being
in
the
bedroom
,
it
cannot
be
determined
where
the
milk
was
before
the
bedroom
.
