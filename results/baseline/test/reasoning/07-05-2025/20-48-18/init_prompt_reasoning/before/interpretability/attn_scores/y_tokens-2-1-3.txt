Reason
ing
:
Since
John
put
down
the
football
,
it
is
likely
that
the
football
is
in
the
location
where
John
put
it
down
,
which
is
not
specified
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
John
put
down
the
football
earlier
,
and
John
went
to
the
hallway
(
from
previous
context
).
Since
the
football
is
not
mentioned
to
be
moved
or
taken
to
the
garden
,
it
is
likely
to
be
in
the
same
location
where
John
put
it
down
,
which
is
not
specified
but
likely
to
be
the
hallway
.
