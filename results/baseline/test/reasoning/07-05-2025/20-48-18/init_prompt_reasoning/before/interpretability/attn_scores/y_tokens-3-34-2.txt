Reason
ing
:
The
question
is
asking
about
the
milk
's
location
before
the
office
,
but
the
context
sentences
provided
do
not
mention
the
milk
at
all
.
The
previous
context
sentences
(
1
-
13
)
mentioned
the
milk
,
but
not
these
new
ones
(
14
-
15
).
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
the
milk
's
location
before
the
office
based
on
these
new
sentences
.
