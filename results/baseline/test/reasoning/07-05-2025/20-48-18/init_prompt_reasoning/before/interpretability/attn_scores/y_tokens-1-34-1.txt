Reason
ing
:
Sandra
went
back
to
the
garden
,
which
implies
she
was
previously
somewhere
else
,
but
the
context
doesn
't
provide
information
about
that
.
Since
she
went
back
to
the
garden
,
it
's
likely
she
was
not
in
the
hallway
,
and
there
's
no
mention
of
her
being
in
the
office
or
any
other
location
.
