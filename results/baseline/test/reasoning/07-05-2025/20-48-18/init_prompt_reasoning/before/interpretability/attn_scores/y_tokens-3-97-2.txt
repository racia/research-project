Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
mention
of
the
football
being
in
the
kitchen
.
The
only
relevant
information
is
that
Daniel
put
down
the
football
(
sentence

26
)
and
John
went
to
the
hallway
(
sentence

27
).
Since
there
is
no
connection
between
the
football
and
the
kitchen
,
we
cannot
determine
where
the
football
was
before
the
kitchen
.
