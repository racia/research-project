Reason
ing
:
The
garden
is
east
of
the
bathroom
,
which
means
the
bathroom
is
not
west
of
the
garden
.
The
garden
is
also
west
of
the
hallway
,
but
this
information
doesn
't
help
us
determine
what
the
bathroom
is
west
of
.
The
only
other
location
mentioned
is
the
hallway
,
which
is
north
of
the
garden
.
Since
the
garden
is
east
of
the
bathroom
,
it
's
likely
that
the
bathroom
is
not
west
of
the
hallway
either
.
Therefore
,
we
need
to
look
for
another
location
that
might
be
west
of
the
bathroom
.
Answer
:
None
(
there
is
no
information
that
suggests
the
bathroom
is
west
of
any
other
location
).
