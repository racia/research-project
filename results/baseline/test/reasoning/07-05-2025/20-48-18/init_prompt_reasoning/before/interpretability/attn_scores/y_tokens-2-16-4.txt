Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
mention
Mary
taking
the
milk
and
then
leaving
it
,
but
it
doesn
't
specify
where
she
took
it
or
left
it
.
However
,
since
Mary
took
the
milk
,
it
is
likely
that
she
took
it
to
a
location
where
she
left
it
.
Since
there
is
no
mention
of
the
milk
being
moved
or
taken
away
from
that
location
,
it
is
likely
that
the
milk
is
still
at
that
location
.
