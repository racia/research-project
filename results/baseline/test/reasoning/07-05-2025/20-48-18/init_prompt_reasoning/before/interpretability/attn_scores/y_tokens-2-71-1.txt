Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
mention
where
Sandra
got
the
milk
,
but
they
do
mention
that
she
went
back
to
the
bedroom
.
This
implies
that
the
milk
was
obtained
somewhere
before
she
went
back
to
the
bedroom
.
Since
Daniel
went
back
to
the
garden
,
it
is
possible
that
the
milk
was
obtained
in
the
garden
.
