Reason
ing
:
The
milk
was
left
by
John
(
sentence

27
),
but
there
is
no
mention
of
where
it
was
left
.
Since
John
left
the
milk
,
it
is
likely
that
the
milk
is
no
longer
in
the
bathroom
.
However
,
there
is
no
information
about
the
milk
being
moved
to
another
location
.
Therefore
,
the
most
likely
answer
is
that
the
milk
is
still
where
John
left
it
,
but
the
exact
location
is
unknown
.
Answer

unknown
