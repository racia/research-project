Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
location
of
the
football
before
the
kitchen
.
Since
John
picked
up
the
football
"
there
",
and
then
travelled
to
the
kitchen
,
it
can
be
inferred
that
"
there
"
refers
to
a
location
before
the
kitchen
.
The
only
location
mentioned
before
the
kitchen
is
the
bathroom
,
where
John
travelled
to
.
Therefore
,
the
football
was
likely
in
the
bathroom
before
the
kitchen
.
Answer

bathroom
