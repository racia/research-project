Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
provided
do
not
mention
the
milk
being
moved
or
taken
to
a
specific
location
after
Sandra
picked
up
the
football
(
sentence

16
).
However
,
we
know
that
Sandra
previously
put
down
the
milk
(
sentence

12
),
but
the
location
is
not
specified
.
Since
the
football
is
now
in
the
hallway
,
it
is
possible
that
the
milk
is
still
in
the
same
location
where
Sandra
put
it
down
,
but
this
is
not
explicitly
stated
.
