Reason
ing
:
The
football
was
taken
by
Mary
to
the
hallway
(
from
previous
context
sentences
),
but
there
is
no
indication
of
its
current
location
.
However
,
it
was
discarded
by
Mary
,
which
implies
that
it
is
no
longer
in
the
hallway
.
Since
there
is
no
mention
of
the
football
being
moved
to
a
different
location
,
it
can
be
inferred
that
it
is
still
in
the
hallway
.
