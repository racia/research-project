Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
mention
Mary
grabbing
the
apple
,
but
do
not
specify
where
it
was
grabbed
.
However
,
the
sentence
"
Mary
left
the
apple
"
implies
that
the
apple
is
no
longer
in
the
location
where
it
was
grabbed
.
Since
Daniel
moved
to
the
kitchen
and
then
to
the
office
,
it
is
likely
that
the
apple
is
in
one
of
these
locations
.
However
,
without
more
information
,
we
cannot
determine
the
exact
location
.
