Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
football
's
location
before
it
was
in
the
garden
.
According
to
sentence

22
,
Daniel
got
the
football
in
the
bathroom
.
Since
Daniel
moved
to
the
garden
(
sentence

26
),
it
implies
that
the
football
was
somewhere
before
Daniel
moved
to
the
garden
.
The
only
location
mentioned
before
the
garden
is
the
kitchen
,
where
Daniel
travelled
to
(
sentence

25
).
However
,
sentence

25
does
not
specify
what
Daniel
did
in
the
kitchen
,
so
we
cannot
conclude
that
the
football
was
in
the
kitchen
.
The
only
specific
location
mentioned
is
the
bathroom
,
where
Daniel
got
the
football
.
Therefore
,
the
football
was
in
the
bathroom
before
it
was
in
the
garden
.
Answer

bathroom
