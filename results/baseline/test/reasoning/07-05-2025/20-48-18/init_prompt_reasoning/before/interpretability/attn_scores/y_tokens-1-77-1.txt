Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Mary
's
location
,
and
the
only
information
provided
is
that
Mary
went
to
the
bathroom
.
Since
there
is
no
mention
of
John
's
location
affecting
Mary
's
,
we
can
focus
on
Mary
's
specific
action
.
The
sentence
only
mentions
Mary
's
action
,
not
John
's
,
so
we
can
't
infer
Mary
's
location
from
John
's
.
Answer
:
bathroom
