Reason
ing
:
The
apple
is
mentioned
in
sentences

21
and

22
,
where
Daniel
took
and
discarded
it
,
respectively
.
Sentence

21
does
not
specify
where
Daniel
took
the
apple
,
but
sentence

22
implies
that
he
discarded
it
"
there
",
which
is
likely
referring
to
the
same
location
where
he
took
it
.
Since
there
is
no
mention
of
where
Daniel
put
down
the
apple
in
sentence

20
,
it
is
likely
that
he
put
it
down
at
the
same
location
where
he
discarded
it
.
