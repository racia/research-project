Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
mention
John
getting

twice
,
and
Daniel
getting
the
apple
.
There
is
no
mention
of
John
getting
the
apple

vice
versa
.
Since
Daniel
got
the
apple
,
it
is
likely
that
he
is
holding
it
.
The
question
asks
about
the
apple
's
location
,
and
since
Daniel
journey
ed
to
the
kitchen
,
it
is
likely
that
the
apple
is
with
him
in
the
kitchen
.
