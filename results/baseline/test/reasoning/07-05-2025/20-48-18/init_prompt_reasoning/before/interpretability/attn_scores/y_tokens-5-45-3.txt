Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
show
that
Mary
handed
the
apple
to
Bill
(
sentence

72
),
but
there
is
no
mention
of
who
gave
the
apple
to
Mary
.
However
,
sentence

71
implies
that
Mary
got
the
apple
,
which
means
she
must
have
received
it
from
someone
.
Since
Bill
handed
the
apple
to
Mary
(
question

66
),
it
is
likely
that
Mary
gave
the
apple
to
Bill
.

Mary
