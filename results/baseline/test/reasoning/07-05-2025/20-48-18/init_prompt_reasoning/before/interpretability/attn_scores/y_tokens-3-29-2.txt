Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
the
location
of
the
milk
before
the
bedroom
.
We
can
infer
that
the
milk
was
in
the
office
because
John
got
the
milk
(
sentence

13
)
and
then
went
to
the
office
(
sentence

8
).
Later
,
John
dropped
the
milk
there
(
sentence

18
),
which
implies
that
the
milk
was
in
the
office
before
being
dropped
.
Since
the
question
asks
about
the
milk
before
the
bedroom
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
milk
was
in
the
office
before
the
bedroom
.
