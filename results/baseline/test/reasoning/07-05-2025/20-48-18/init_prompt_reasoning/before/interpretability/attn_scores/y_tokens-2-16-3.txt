Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
mention
Mary
leaving
the
milk
,
but
it
doesn
't
specify
where
she
left
it
.
However
,
since
Mary
grabbed
the
milk
in
the
office
(
sentence

8
),
it
is
likely
that
she
left
it
in
the
office
or
hallway
,
as
she
moved
to
the
hallway
(
sentence

11
).
There
is
no
mention
of
the
milk
being
moved
or
taken
away
from
the
office
or
hallway
.
Answer
:
office
or
hallway
