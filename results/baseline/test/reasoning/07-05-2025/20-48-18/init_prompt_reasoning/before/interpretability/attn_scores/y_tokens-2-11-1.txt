Reason
ing
:
Since
Daniel
took
the
milk
"
there
",
and
John
journey
ed
to
the
garden
,
it
is
likely
that
"
there
"
refers
to
the
garden
.
However
,
Daniel
went
back
to
the
hallway
and
then
journey
ed
to
the
bathroom
,
which
suggests
that
the
milk
might
not
be
in
the
hallway
or
the
bathroom
.
Therefore
,
the
most
likely
location
of
the
milk
is
the
garden
.
