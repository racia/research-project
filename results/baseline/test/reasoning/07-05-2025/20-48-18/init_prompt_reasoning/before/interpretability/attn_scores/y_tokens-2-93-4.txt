Reason
ing
:
The
football
was
dropped
by
Mary
(
sentence

33
),
and
there
is
no
mention
of
anyone
picking
it
up
or
moving
it
after
that
.
Therefore
,
the
football
is
likely
to
be
in
the
same
location
where
it
was
dropped
,
which
is
the
bedroom
(
since
Mary
travelled
to
the
bedroom
before
dropping
the
football
).
Answer

bedroom
