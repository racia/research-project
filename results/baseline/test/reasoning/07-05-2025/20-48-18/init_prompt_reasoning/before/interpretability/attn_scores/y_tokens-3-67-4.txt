Reason
ing
:
The
football
was
put
down
(
sentence

39
),
but
its
location
before
that
is
not
specified
.
However
,
we
know
that
John
discarded
the
football
(
sentence

9
)
and
Mary
picked
it
up
(
sentence

18
)
before
putting
it
down
.
Since
John
discarded
the
football
,
it
's
likely
that
the
football
was
in
the
hallway
(
where
John
discarded
it
)
before
the
bedroom
.
Answer

hallway
