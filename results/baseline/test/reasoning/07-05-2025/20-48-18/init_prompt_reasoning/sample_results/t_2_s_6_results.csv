3. John left the football there.
4. Mary journeyed to the hallway.
5. John grabbed the milk there.
6. John travelled to the kitchen.

Now, answer the following question:
Where is the milk?"	kitchen	from sentence 5, we know that john grabbed the milk in the hallway. however, in sentence 6, it is mentioned that john travelled to the kitchen. since john already had the milk with him (he grabbed it in the hallway), it is logical to assume that he took the milk with him to the kitchen. therefore, the milk is currently in the kitchen.	fully	kitchen	True	The context sentences suggest that John grabbed the milk in the hallway (sentence 5), but then travelled to the kitchen (sentence 6). Since John is now in the kitchen, it is likely that the milk is still with him in the kitchen.

Now, answer the following question:
Where is the milk?"	kitchen	the context sentences 8 and 9 do not provide any information about the milk. however, we can look at the previous parts of the conversation history. in the previous part, we concluded that the milk is in the kitchen (sentence 6: john travelled to the kitchen, and we assumed that he took the milk with him). this information is still valid, and there is no new information that would change the location of the milk. therefore, the milk is still in the kitchen	none	not mentioned	False	There is no mention of milk in the given context sentences.
