Here are the context sentences:
1. The garden is east of the bathroom.
2. The garden is west of the hallway.

Now, answer the following question:
What is the bathroom west of?"	garden	"from the context sentences, we know that the garden is east of the bathroom (sentence 1) and the garden is west of the hallway (sentence 2). since the garden is east of the bathroom, it means the bathroom is west of the garden. therefore, the answer is ""garden""."	fully	None (there is no information that suggests the bathroom is west of any other location).	False	The garden is east of the bathroom, which means the bathroom is not west of the garden. The garden is also west of the hallway, but this information doesn't help us determine what the bathroom is west of. The only other location mentioned is the hallway, which is north of the garden. Since the garden is east of the bathroom, it's likely that the bathroom is not west of the hallway either. Therefore, we need to look for another location that might be west of the bathroom.
