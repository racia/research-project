Here are the context sentences:
1. Mary journeyed to the garden.
2. Mary travelled to the office.

Now, answer the following question:
Where is Mary?"	office	the context sentences provide information about mary's movements. in sentence 1, mary journeyed to the garden, which means she was in the garden at some point. however, sentence 2 states that mary travelled to the office, which implies that she left the garden and went to the office. since the question asks about mary's current location, the most recent information about her movement (sentence 2) takes precedence, indicating that mary is currently at the office.	fully	office	True	The context sentences provide two locations where Mary has been: the garden and the office. Since the question asks about Mary's current location, we need to consider both possibilities. However, there is no information that suggests Mary has moved from one location to the other, so we can't infer her current location based on the previous actions. Therefore, we need to consider both locations as possibilities.		"Reasoning: The context sentences provide two locations where Mary has been: the garden and the office.
