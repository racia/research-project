Here are the context sentences:
1. The hallway is south of the bedroom.
2. The bathroom is south of the hallway.

Now, answer the following question:
What is the bedroom north of?"	hallway	"from the context sentences, we know that the hallway is south of the bedroom (sentence 1). this implies that the bedroom is north of the hallway, since ""south of"" and ""north of"" are opposite directions. therefore, the correct answer is the hallway."	fully	Nothing	False	Since the hallway is south of the bedroom, and the bathroom is south of the hallway, it implies that the bedroom is not south of anything. Therefore, it cannot be north of anything either, as it is not south of anything.		"Reasoning: Since the hallway is south of the bedroom, and the bathroom is south of the hallway, it implies that the bedroom is not south of anything. Therefore, it cannot be north of anything either, as it is not south of anything.
