Where is the apple?"	hallway	from context sentence 3, we know that john grabbed the apple there, which implies that the apple was in the same location as john. then, from context sentence 5, we know that john journeyed to the hallway. since john had the apple, it is logical to assume that the apple also went to the hallway with john. therefore, the apple is in the hallway.	fully	hallway	True	The context sentences do not mention the apple being put down or moved to a specific location. However, John grabbed the apple, and then Sandra went to the hallway, and John journeyed to the hallway as well. This suggests that the apple is still with John, and since John is in the hallway, the apple is likely in the hallway as well.
