Here are the context sentences:
1. The yellow square is to the right of the blue square.
2. The yellow square is below the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square to the right of the triangle?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is to the right of the blue square (sentence 1) and the yellow square is below the triangle (sentence 2). since the yellow square is below the triangle, it means the triangle is above the yellow square. now, if the blue square is to the right of the triangle, it would mean the blue square is above the yellow square, which contradicts sentence 1. therefore, the blue square cannot be to	fully	no	True			Answer: no	0.25	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the right of the blue square?"	yes	from the previous context sentences, we know that the yellow square is to the right of the blue square (sentence 1) and the yellow square is below the triangle (sentence 2). since the yellow square is below the triangle, it means the triangle is above the yellow square. and since the yellow square is to the right of the blue square, the triangle (which is above the yellow square) must be to the right of the blue square.	none	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square to the right of the triangle?"	no	we previously established that the triangle is to the right of the blue square (in the previous question). therefore, it is not possible for the blue square to be to the right of the triangle. the correct relationship is the opposite: the triangle is to the right of the blue square.	none	no	True			Answer: no	0.25	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle below the blue square?"	no	from the previous context sentences, we know that the yellow square is below the triangle (sentence 2). we also know that the yellow square is to the right of the blue square (sentence 1). if the triangle were below the blue square, it would mean the triangle is below the yellow square, which contradicts sentence 2. therefore, the triangle cannot be below the blue square.	none	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.4	False	False	False	True	0
