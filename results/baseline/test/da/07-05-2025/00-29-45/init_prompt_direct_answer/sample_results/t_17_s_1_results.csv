1. The pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle.
2. The triangle is to the left of the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the right of the red square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the left of the red square (sentence 2). therefore, we can logically conclude that the pink rectangle is to the left of the red square, not to the right. this is because if a is to the left of b, and b is to the left of c, then a must be to the left of c. in this case	fully	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
