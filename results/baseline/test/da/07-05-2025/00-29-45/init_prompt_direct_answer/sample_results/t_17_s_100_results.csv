2. The red square is below the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle below the blue square?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red square is to the left of the pink rectangle, which implies that the pink rectangle is to the right of the red square. from context sentence 2, we know that the red square is below the blue square. since the pink rectangle is to the right of the red square, and the red square is below the blue square, we can logically conclude that the pink rectangle is also below the blue square.	fully	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
