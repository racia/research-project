Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is above the yellow square.
2. The triangle is to the left of the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle above the red sphere?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the red sphere is above the yellow square (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the left of the yellow square (sentence 2). there is no information provided about the vertical position of the triangle relative to the red sphere. however, since the triangle is to the left of the yellow square and the red sphere is above the yellow square, it can be logically inferred that the triangle is not above the red sphere. if the triangle were	fully	no	True			Answer: no	0.25	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the left of the red sphere?"	yes	from the context sentences provided earlier, we know that the triangle is to the left of the yellow square (sentence 2), and the red sphere is above the yellow square (sentence 1). since the triangle is to the left of the yellow square and the red sphere is above the yellow square, it can be logically inferred that the triangle is also to the left of the red sphere, as the yellow square is a common reference point for both the triangle and the red sphere.	none	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere above the triangle?"	yes	we know that the red sphere is above the yellow square (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the left of the yellow square (sentence 2). since the triangle is to the left of the yellow square, it must be below the yellow square (as it is not above or at the same level). and since the red sphere is above the yellow square, it must be above the triangle as well.	none	no	False			Answer: no	0.25	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
