2. The container fits inside the suitcase.
3. The suitcase is bigger than the chest.
4. The box is bigger than the box of chocolates.
5. The chest is bigger than the box of chocolates.

Now, answer the following question:
Does the suitcase fit in the box of chocolates?"	no	from context sentence 1, we know that the suitcase is bigger than the chest. from context sentence 5, we know that the chest is bigger than the box of chocolates. therefore, we can logically conclude that the suitcase is also bigger than the box of chocolates (since the suitcase is bigger than the chest, and the chest is bigger than the box of chocolates). this means that the suitcase cannot fit inside the box of chocolates, hence the answer is no.	fully	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
