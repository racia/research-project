Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is below the triangle.
2. The blue square is above the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square to the right of the triangle?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the blue square is below the triangle (sentence 1) and above the yellow square (sentence 2). this implies that the yellow square is below the blue square. since the blue square is below the triangle, the yellow square must also be below the triangle. there is no information provided about the left-right orientation of the shapes, but we can infer that the yellow square is not to the right of the triangle because it is below the triangle	fully	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.4	False	False	False	True	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square to the right of the triangle?"	no	there is no direct information about the left-right orientation of the shapes in the context sentences. however, we can infer that the yellow square is not to the right of the triangle because we previously established that the yellow square is below the triangle (from the previous question). if the yellow square were to the right of the triangle, it would imply a horizontal relationship, which is not supported by the provided information. therefore, the answer to the question is no, the yellow square is not to	none	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.4	False	False	False	True	0
