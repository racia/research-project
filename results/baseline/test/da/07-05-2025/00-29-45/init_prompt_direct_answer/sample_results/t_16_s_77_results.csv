Here are the context sentences:
1. Brian is a swan.
2. Lily is a lion.
3. Julius is a frog.
4. Julius is yellow.
5. Lily is green.
6. Brian is green.
7. Bernhard is a lion.
8. Greg is a frog.
9. Greg is white.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Bernhard?"	green	since bernhard is a lion (sentence 7), and lily is also a lion (sentence 2), we can infer that bernhard and lily share the same characteristics. we know that lily is green (sentence 5), so it is logical to assume that bernhard, being a lion like lily, is also green.	fully	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.6	False	False	False	True	0
