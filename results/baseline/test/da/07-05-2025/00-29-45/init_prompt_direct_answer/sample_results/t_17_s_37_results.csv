Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square below the triangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the blue square (sentence 1) and the pink rectangle is below the triangle (sentence 2). since the pink rectangle is below the triangle, and the blue square is to the right of the pink rectangle, we can logically conclude that the blue square is also below the triangle.	fully	no	False			Answer: no	0.25	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle above the blue square?"	yes	from the previous context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is below the triangle (sentence 2) and the pink rectangle is to the left of the blue square (sentence 1). since the pink rectangle is below the triangle, it means the triangle is above the pink rectangle. and since the pink rectangle is to the left of the blue square, it means the blue square is to the right of the pink rectangle. therefore, the triangle is above the blue square.	none	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.4	False	False	False	True	0
