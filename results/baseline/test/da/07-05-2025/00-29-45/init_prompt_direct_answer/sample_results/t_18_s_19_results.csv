Here are the context sentences:


Now, answer the following question:
Does the box fit in the chocolate?"	no	there is no context provided about the box fitting in the chocolate. however, we can infer that the box does not fit in the chocolate because in a typical scenario, a box is a container that holds an object, and the object (in this case, the chocolate) does not hold the container. additionally, the question itself implies that the box is a separate entity from the chocolate, which further supports the conclusion that the box does not fit in the chocolate.	none	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
