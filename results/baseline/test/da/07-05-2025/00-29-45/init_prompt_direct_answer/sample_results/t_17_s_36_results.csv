Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is to the left of the triangle.
2. The red square is to the right of the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle above the yellow square?"	no	from context sentence 1, we know that the red square is to the left of the triangle. from context sentence 2, we know that the red square is to the right of the yellow square. this implies that the yellow square is to the left of the red square. since the red square is to the left of the triangle, the yellow square must also be to the left of the triangle. there is no information provided about the vertical positions of the triangle and the yellow square	fully	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square below the triangle?"	no	"there is no information provided about the vertical positions of the triangle and the yellow square. the context sentences only mention the left and right relationships between the objects, but not their vertical relationships. therefore, we cannot conclude that the yellow square is below the triangle, and the answer is ""no""."	none	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square to the left of the triangle?"	yes	from the previous context sentences, we know that the red square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 1) and the red square is to the right of the yellow square (sentence 2). therefore, we can logically conclude that the yellow square is to the left of the red square. since the red square is to the left of the triangle, the yellow square must also be to the left of the triangle.	none	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.4	False	False	False	True	0
