1. Bernhard is a lion.
2. Lily is a lion.
3. Lily is yellow.
4. Greg is a rhino.
5. Bernhard is yellow.
6. Julius is a rhino.
7. Greg is green.
8. Brian is a frog.
9. Brian is white.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Julius?"	green	since julius is a rhino (sentence 6), and greg is also a rhino (sentence 4), we can infer that julius and greg share the same characteristics. we know that greg is green (sentence 7), so it is logical to assume that julius, being a rhino like greg, is also green.	fully	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.6	False	False	False	True	0
