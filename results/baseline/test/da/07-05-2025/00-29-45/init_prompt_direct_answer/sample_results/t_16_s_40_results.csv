Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	white	since lily is a swan (context sentence 3), and bernhard is also a swan (context sentence 6), we can infer that they share similar characteristics. additionally, bernhard is white (context sentence 9). therefore, it is logical to assume that lily, being a swan like bernhard, is also white.	fully	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.2	0.6	False	False	False	True	0
