Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is to the right of the triangle.
2. The red sphere is above the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the left of the blue square?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red sphere is to the right of the triangle. from context sentence 2, we know that the red sphere is above the blue square. since the red sphere is above the blue square, it means the blue square is below the red sphere. now, if the red sphere is to the right of the triangle, and the blue square is below the red sphere, it logically follows that the triangle must be to the left of the blue	fully	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle above the blue square?"	yes	from the previous context sentences, we know that the red sphere is above the blue square (sentence 2). we also know that the red sphere is to the right of the triangle (sentence 1). since the red sphere is above the blue square and to the right of the triangle, it logically follows that the triangle must be above the blue square as well, because the red sphere is above the blue square and the triangle is to the left of the red sphere.	none	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
