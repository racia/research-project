Here are the context sentences:
1. Lily is a lion.
2. Lily is gray.
3. Greg is a rhino.
4. Brian is a frog.
5. Julius is a frog.
6. Greg is white.
7. Julius is green.
8. Bernhard is a lion.
9. Bernhard is yellow.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Brian?"	green	since there is no direct information about brian's color in the context sentences, we need to make an inference. we know that julius is also a frog (sentence 5) and julius is green (sentence 7). as both brian and julius are frogs, it is logical to assume that they share similar characteristics, including their color. therefore, we can infer that brian is also green.	fully	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.4	0.6	False	False	False	True	0
