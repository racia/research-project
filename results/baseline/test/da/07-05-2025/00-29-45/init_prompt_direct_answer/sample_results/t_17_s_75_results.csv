Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is to the left of the red square.
2. The red sphere is below the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere to the right of the triangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is to the left of the red square (sentence 1). we also know that the red sphere is below the red square (sentence 2). since the red sphere is below the red square, and the triangle is to the left of the red square, it can be logically inferred that the red sphere is to the right of the triangle.	fully	no	False			Answer: no	0.25	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the right of the red sphere?"	no	from the previous context sentences, we know that the triangle is to the left of the red square (sentence 1), and the red sphere is below the red square (sentence 2). since the triangle is to the left of the red square, and the red sphere is below the red square, it can be logically inferred that the triangle is not to the right of the red sphere. in fact, the red sphere is to the right of the triangle, as previously established.	none	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
