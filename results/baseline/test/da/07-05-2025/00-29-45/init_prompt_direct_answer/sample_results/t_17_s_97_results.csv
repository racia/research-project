Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is below the red sphere.
2. The red square is to the left of the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere to the left of the red square?"	no	from context sentence 1, we know that the triangle is below the red sphere, which implies that the red sphere is above the triangle. from context sentence 2, we know that the red square is to the left of the triangle. since the red sphere is above the triangle and the red square is to the left of the triangle, it can be logically inferred that the red sphere is not to the left of the red square. therefore, the answer is no.	fully	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the left of the red sphere?"	yes	from the previous context sentences, we know that the red square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 2), and the triangle is below the red sphere (sentence 1). since the triangle is below the red sphere, it can be logically inferred that the red sphere is above the triangle. therefore, the red square, which is to the left of the triangle, must also be to the left of the red sphere, which is above the triangle. hence, the answer is	none	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the left of the red sphere?"	yes	we have already established in a previous question that the red square is to the left of the triangle, and the triangle is below the red sphere. therefore, it can be logically inferred that the red square, which is to the left of the triangle, is also to the left of the red sphere, which is above the triangle.	none	yes	True			Answer: yes	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
