2. The pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the left of the red square?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red sphere is below the red square. from context sentence 2, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere. since the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere, and the red sphere is below the red square, we can logically conclude that the pink rectangle is to the left of the red square.	fully	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
