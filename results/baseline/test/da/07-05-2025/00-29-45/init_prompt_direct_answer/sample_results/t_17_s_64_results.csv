Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is to the left of the blue square.
2. The red square is to the left of the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the left of the blue square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is to the left of the blue square (sentence 1). we also know that the red square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 2). therefore, we can logically conclude that the red square is to the left of the blue square, as it is to the left of the triangle, and the triangle is to the left of the blue square. this forms a transitive relationship, where the red square is to the	fully	yes	True			Answer: yes	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
