Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is above the red square.
2. The red square is above the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle above the pink rectangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is above the red square (sentence 1), and the red square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 2). therefore, we can logically conclude that the triangle is above the pink rectangle, as it is above the red square, which in turn is above the pink rectangle. this forms a vertical hierarchy of objects, with the triangle at the top, followed by the red square, and then the pink rectangle at the bottom.	fully	yes	True			Answer: yes	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle above the triangle?"	no	from the previous context sentences, we know that the triangle is above the red square (sentence 1), and the red square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 2). therefore, we can logically conclude that the pink rectangle is below the red square, and the red square is below the triangle. hence, the pink rectangle cannot be above the triangle.	none	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle below the triangle?"	yes	from the previous context sentences, we know that the triangle is above the red square (sentence 1), and the red square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 2). therefore, we can logically conclude that the pink rectangle is below the red square, and the red square is below the triangle. hence, the pink rectangle is indeed below the triangle.	none	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle above the pink rectangle?"	yes	we have already established that the triangle is above the red square (sentence 1), and the red square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 2). therefore, we can logically conclude that the triangle is above the pink rectangle, as it is above the red square, which in turn is above the pink rectangle.	none	yes	True			Answer: yes	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Here are the context sentences:


Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the right of the triangle?"	no	the context sentences only provide information about the vertical relationships between the objects (above/below), but do not mention anything about their horizontal relationships (left/right). therefore, we cannot conclude that the pink rectangle is to the right of the triangle, as there is no information provided to support this claim.	none	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.4	False	False	False	True	0
