Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the left of the blue square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the red square (sentence 1), and the red square is to the left of the blue square (sentence 2). by transitivity, we can conclude that the pink rectangle is to the left of the blue square. this is because if a is to the left of b, and b is to the left of c, then a is to the left of c. in this case, a is	fully	yes	True			Answer: yes	0.25	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
