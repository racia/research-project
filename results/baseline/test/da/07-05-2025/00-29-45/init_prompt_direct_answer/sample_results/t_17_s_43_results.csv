Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is above the red sphere.
2. The triangle is to the right of the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere to the right of the blue square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is above the red sphere (sentence 1) and the triangle is to the right of the blue square (sentence 2). since the triangle is above the red sphere, the red sphere must be below the triangle. and since the triangle is to the right of the blue square, the red sphere (which is below the triangle) must also be to the right of the blue square. therefore, the answer is yes, the red	fully	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere above the blue square?"	no	from the previous context sentences, we know that the triangle is above the red sphere (sentence 1) and the triangle is to the right of the blue square (sentence 2). since the triangle is above the red sphere, the red sphere must be below the triangle. if the red sphere were above the blue square, the triangle would also be above the blue square, which contradicts the fact that the triangle is to the right of the blue square. therefore, the answer is	none	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
