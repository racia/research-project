Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square above the blue square?"	no	"from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is to the left of the blue square (sentence 1), and the red square is below the yellow square (sentence 2). this means that the red square is not above the blue square, but rather below the yellow square, which is to the left of the blue square. therefore, the correct answer is ""no"", the red square is not above the blue square."	fully	no	True			Answer: no	0.25	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square above the red square?"	yes	"we have already established in previous questions that the yellow square is to the left of the blue square, and the red square is below the yellow square. therefore, it logically follows that the blue square is above the red square. this is a direct consequence of the spatial relationships established in the context sentences, and thus the correct answer is indeed ""yes"", the blue square is above the red square."	none	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
