Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is below the triangle.
2. The blue square is below the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the left of the blue square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the red sphere is below the triangle (sentence 1), and the blue square is below the red sphere (sentence 2). this implies that the blue square is also below the triangle, since the red sphere is an intermediate object between the triangle and the blue square. there is no information provided about the left-right orientation of the objects, only their vertical relationships. therefore, we cannot conclude that the triangle is to the left of the blue square	fully	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square to the left of the triangle?"	no	"since there is no context provided, we cannot determine the left-right orientation of the objects. the answer ""no"" implies that we cannot conclude that the blue square is to the left of the triangle, but it does not provide any information about their actual positions. without additional context, we cannot infer any spatial relationships between the blue square and the triangle."	none	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square below the triangle?"	yes	from the previous conversation, we know that the blue square is below the red sphere (sentence 2), and the red sphere is below the triangle (sentence 1). therefore, we can logically conclude that the blue square is below the triangle, as it is below an object (the red sphere) that is itself below the triangle.	none	yes	True			Answer: yes	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
