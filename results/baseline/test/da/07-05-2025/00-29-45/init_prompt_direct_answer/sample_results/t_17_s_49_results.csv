Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle above the blue square?"	no	"there is no information provided about the vertical positions of the objects (blue square, yellow square, and triangle). the context sentences only mention the left-right relationships between them. therefore, we cannot conclude that the triangle is above or below the blue square. the answer ""no"" simply means that there is no evidence to suggest that the triangle is above the blue square, but it does not imply that it is below or at the same level as the blue square."	none	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.4	False	False	False	True	0
