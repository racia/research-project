Here are the context sentences:
1. Bernhard is a rhino.
2. Brian is a rhino.
3. Bernhard is white.
4. Brian is white.
5. Lily is a lion.
6. Lily is yellow.
7. Greg is a rhino.
8. Greg is green.
9. Julius is a rhino.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Julius?"	green	since julius is a rhino (sentence 9), and we know that bernhard and brian are also rhinos and they are both white (sentences 1, 2, 3, and 4), but greg, who is also a rhino (sentence 7), is green (sentence 8), it is likely that julius, being a rhino, is also green, following the pattern of greg.	fully	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.2	0.6	False	False	False	True	0
