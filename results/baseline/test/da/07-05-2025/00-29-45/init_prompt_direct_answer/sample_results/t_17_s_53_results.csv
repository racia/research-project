Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is below the red sphere.
2. The yellow square is below the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere above the yellow square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is below the red sphere (sentence 1), and the yellow square is below the triangle (sentence 2). therefore, we can logically conclude that the yellow square is below the triangle, and the triangle is below the red sphere. this implies that the red sphere is above the yellow square, which is the correct answer.	fully	yes	True			Answer: yes	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square below the red sphere?"	yes	we already established in previous questions that the triangle is below the red sphere, and the yellow square is below the triangle. therefore, we can logically conclude that the yellow square is below the triangle, and the triangle is below the red sphere. this implies that the yellow square is indeed below the red sphere, which is the correct answer.	none	yes	True			Answer: yes	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
