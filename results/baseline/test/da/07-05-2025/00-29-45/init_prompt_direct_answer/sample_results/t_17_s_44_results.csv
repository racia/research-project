Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is to the left of the triangle.
2. The red square is below the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere below the triangle?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the red square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 1) and the red square is below the red sphere (sentence 2). since the red square is below the red sphere, the red sphere must be above the red square. and since the red square is to the left of the triangle, the red sphere (which is above the red square) cannot be below the triangle. therefore, the answer is no, the red sphere	fully	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle above the red sphere?"	no	we already established in the previous question that the red sphere is above the triangle (since the red square is below the red sphere and the red square is to the left of the triangle). therefore, it cannot be the case that the triangle is above the red sphere. the correct relationship is the opposite: the red sphere is above the triangle. hence, the answer is no, the triangle is not above the red sphere.	none	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
