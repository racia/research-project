Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is to the right of the red sphere.
2. The blue square is to the left of the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere above the red square?"	no	"the context sentences only provide information about the relative positions of the blue square and the red sphere/square in the horizontal direction (left and right). there is no information provided about the vertical direction (above or below). therefore, we cannot conclude that the red sphere is above the red square, and the answer is ""no""."	fully	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.2	0.4	False	False	False	True	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere to the left of the red square?"	yes	from the previous context sentences (1. the blue square is to the right of the red sphere. 2. the blue square is to the left of the red square.), we can infer that the red sphere and the red square are on the same horizontal line. since the blue square is to the right of the red sphere and to the left of the red square, the red sphere must be to the left of the red square.	none	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
