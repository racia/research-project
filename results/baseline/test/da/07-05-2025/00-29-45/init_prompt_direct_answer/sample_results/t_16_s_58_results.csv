Here are the context sentences:
1. Julius is a swan.
2. Bernhard is a swan.
3. Bernhard is yellow.
4. Julius is yellow.
5. Greg is a lion.
6. Lily is a rhino.
7. Greg is yellow.
8. Brian is a rhino.
9. Lily is gray.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Brian?"	gray	since brian is a rhino (sentence 8), and lily is also a rhino (sentence 6), it can be inferred that they share similar characteristics. additionally, sentence 9 states that lily is gray. therefore, it is logical to assume that brian, being a rhino like lily, is also gray.	fully	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.2	0.6	False	False	False	True	0
