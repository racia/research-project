Here are the context sentences:
1. Brian is a frog.
2. Bernhard is a lion.
3. Brian is gray.
4. Julius is a frog.
5. Bernhard is gray.
6. Julius is white.
7. Greg is a frog.
8. Lily is a lion.
9. Greg is yellow.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	gray	since lily is a lion (sentence 8), and bernhard is also a lion (sentence 2), we can infer that lily's color is likely to be similar to bernhard's color. bernhard is gray (sentence 5), so it is logical to assume that lily is also gray.	fully	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.6	False	False	False	True	0
