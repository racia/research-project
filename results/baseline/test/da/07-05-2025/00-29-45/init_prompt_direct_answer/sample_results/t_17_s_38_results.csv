Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is below the red sphere.
2. The yellow square is to the left of the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square below the red square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the red square is below the red sphere (sentence 1), and the yellow square is to the left of the red sphere (sentence 2). since the yellow square is to the left of the red sphere, and the red square is below the red sphere, it can be logically inferred that the yellow square is not below the red square. if the yellow square were below the red square, it would not be to the left of the red	fully	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square to the left of the red square?"	yes	we know that the yellow square is to the left of the red sphere (sentence 2), and the red square is below the red sphere (sentence 1). since the yellow square is to the left of the red sphere, and the red square is below the red sphere, it can be logically inferred that the yellow square is to the left of the red square, as they are both related to the same reference point (the red sphere).	none	no information	False			Answer: no information	0.0	0.4	False	False	False	True	0
