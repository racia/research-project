Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is to the left of the red square.
2. The red sphere is to the left of the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the right of the red sphere?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the blue square is to the left of the red square. from context sentence 2, we know that the red sphere is to the left of the blue square. therefore, the red sphere is to the left of the blue square, and the blue square is to the left of the red square. this implies that the red sphere is to the left of the red square. since the red sphere is to the left of the red square,	fully	no	False			Answer: no	0.25	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square above the red sphere?"	no	"there is no information provided about the vertical positions of the red square and the red sphere. the context sentences only mention left and right relationships between the objects, but do not provide any information about up or down relationships. therefore, we cannot conclude that the red square is above the red sphere, and the answer is ""no"" because there is no evidence to support that claim."	none	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.4	False	False	False	True	0
