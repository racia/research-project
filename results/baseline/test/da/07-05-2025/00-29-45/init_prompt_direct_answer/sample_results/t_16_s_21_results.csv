Here are the context sentences:
1. Greg is a frog.
2. Lily is a lion.
3. Bernhard is a frog.
4. Julius is a swan.
5. Brian is a lion.
6. Brian is yellow.
7. Greg is yellow.
8. Bernhard is yellow.
9. Julius is green.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	yellow	since lily is a lion (sentence 2), and brian is also a lion (sentence 5), we can infer that lily and brian share the same characteristics as they belong to the same species. additionally, sentence 6 states that brian is yellow, which implies that lions are typically yellow. therefore, it is logical to assume that lily, being a lion, is also yellow.	fully	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.2	0.6	False	False	False	True	0
