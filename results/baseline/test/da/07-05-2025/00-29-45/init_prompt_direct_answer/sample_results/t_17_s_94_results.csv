Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is below the yellow square.
2. The pink rectangle is to the right of the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square above the triangle?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the pink rectangle is below the yellow square. from context sentence 2, we know that the pink rectangle is to the right of the triangle. since the pink rectangle is below the yellow square and to the right of the triangle, we can logically conclude that the yellow square is above the triangle.	fully	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
