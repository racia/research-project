1. Julius is a lion.
2. Julius is yellow.

4. Lily is a rhino.
5. Bernhard is a swan.
6. Lily is yellow.
7. Bernhard is yellow.
8. Brian is a frog.
9. Greg is gray.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Brian?"	gray	since brian is a frog (sentence 8), and greg is also a frog (sentence 3), it can be inferred that they share similar characteristics. additionally, it is known that greg is gray (sentence 9). therefore, it is logical to assume that brian, being a frog like greg, also shares the same color, which is gray.	fully	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.6	False	False	False	True	0
