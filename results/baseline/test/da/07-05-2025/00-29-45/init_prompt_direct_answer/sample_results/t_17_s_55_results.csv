Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square above the red sphere?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere (sentence 1). we also know that the yellow square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 2). since the yellow square is above the pink rectangle, and the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere, we can logically conclude that the yellow square is above the red sphere.	fully	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere above the yellow square?"	no	from the previous context sentences, we know that the yellow square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 2), and the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere (sentence 1). there is no information suggesting that the red sphere is above the yellow square. in fact, the opposite is implied, since the yellow square is above the pink rectangle, and the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere, which means the yellow square is above the red sphere. therefore	none	no	True			Answer: no	0.25	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
