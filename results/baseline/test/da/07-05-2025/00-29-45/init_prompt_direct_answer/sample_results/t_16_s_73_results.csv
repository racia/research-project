2. Julius is a lion.
3. Brian is a frog.
4. Lily is a lion.
5. Brian is gray.
6. Lily is green.
7. Julius is green.
8. Greg is yellow.
9. Bernhard is a swan.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Bernhard?"	yellow	since bernhard is a swan (sentence 9), and greg is also a swan (sentence 1), it can be inferred that bernhard and greg share similar characteristics as they belong to the same species. additionally, sentence 8 states that greg is yellow. therefore, it is logical to assume that bernhard, being a swan like greg, also shares the same color, which is yellow.	fully	yellow	True			Answer: yellow	0.5	0.75	False	False	False	False	0
