Here are the context sentences:
1. The yellow square is to the right of the red sphere.
2. The yellow square is to the left of the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the right of the red sphere?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is to the right of the red sphere (sentence 1) and to the left of the red square (sentence 2). this implies that the red sphere is to the left of the yellow square, and the red square is to the right of the yellow square. therefore, the red sphere is to the left of the yellow square, and the red square is to the right of the yellow square, which means the red square	fully	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the left of the red sphere?"	no	from the previous context sentences, we know that the yellow square is to the right of the red sphere (sentence 1) and to the left of the red square (sentence 2). this implies that the red sphere is to the left of the yellow square, and the red square is to the right of the yellow square. therefore, the red sphere is to the left of the red square, which means the red square is not to the left of the red sphere.	none	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the right of the red sphere?"	yes	from the previous context sentences, we know that the yellow square is to the right of the red sphere (sentence 1) and to the left of the red square (sentence 2). this implies that the red sphere is to the left of the yellow square, and the red square is to the right of the yellow square. since the yellow square is between the red sphere and the red square, the red square must be to the right of the red sphere, which matches the answer	none	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere above the red square?"	no	"there is no information provided about the vertical positions of the red sphere and the red square. the context sentences only mention their horizontal positions relative to each other and the yellow square. therefore, we cannot conclude that the red sphere is above or below the red square, and the answer ""no"" simply means that there is no evidence to suggest that the red sphere is above the red square."	none	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.4	False	False	False	True	0
