Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is to the left of the triangle.
2. The triangle is to the left of the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the right of the blue square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the red square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the left of the blue square (sentence 2). this means that the red square is to the left of the triangle, and the triangle is to the left of the blue square. therefore, the red square must be to the left of the blue square, not to the right of it.	fully	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the left of the blue square?"	yes	from the previous context sentences, we know that the red square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the left of the blue square (sentence 2). therefore, we can logically conclude that the red square is to the left of the blue square, as it is to the left of the triangle and the triangle is to the left of the blue square.	none	yes	True			Answer: yes	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square above the red square?"	no	"the context sentences do not provide any information about the vertical positions of the red square and the blue square. they only describe their horizontal positions relative to each other and the triangle. therefore, we cannot conclude that the blue square is above the red square, and the answer is ""no"" because there is no evidence to suggest that it is."	none	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
