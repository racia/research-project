Here are the context sentences:
1. The yellow square is above the triangle.
2. The red sphere is to the left of the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere below the triangle?"	no	from context sentence 1, we know that the yellow square is above the triangle, which means the yellow square is at a higher position than the triangle. from context sentence 2, we know that the red sphere is to the left of the yellow square, but there is no information about the vertical position of the red sphere relative to the triangle. since the yellow square is above the triangle, and the red sphere is to the left of the yellow square, it is likely that the	fully	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle below the red sphere?"	yes	from the previous context sentences, we know that the yellow square is above the triangle (sentence 1), and the red sphere is to the left of the yellow square (sentence 2). since the yellow square is above the triangle, and the red sphere is to the left of the yellow square, it can be inferred that the red sphere is at the same level or below the level of the triangle. therefore, the triangle is not below the red sphere, but rather the opposite:	none	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.4	False	False	False	True	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the left of the red sphere?"	no	"we know that the red sphere is to the left of the yellow square (sentence 2), and the yellow square is above the triangle (sentence 1). if the triangle were to the left of the red sphere, it would mean that the triangle is to the left of the yellow square, which contradicts the fact that the yellow square is above the triangle. therefore, the triangle cannot be to the left of the red sphere, and the correct answer is ""no""."	none	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
