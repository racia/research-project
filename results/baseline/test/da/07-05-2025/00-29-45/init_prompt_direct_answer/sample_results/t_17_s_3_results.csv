Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle.
2. The triangle is below the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere above the pink rectangle?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle. from context sentence 2, we know that the triangle is below the red sphere. since the triangle is below the red sphere, and the pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle, it can be logically inferred that the red sphere is above the pink rectangle.	fully	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle below the red sphere?"	yes	from the previous context sentences, we know that the triangle is below the red sphere (sentence 2) and the pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle (sentence 1). since the triangle is below the red sphere, and the pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle, it can be logically inferred that the pink rectangle is also below the red sphere.	none	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
