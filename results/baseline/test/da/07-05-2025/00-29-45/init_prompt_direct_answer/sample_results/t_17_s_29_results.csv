Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere to the left of the blue square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is below the red sphere (sentence 1), and the blue square is to the left of the yellow square (sentence 2). since the blue square is to the left of the yellow square, and the yellow square is below the red sphere, it can be inferred that the red sphere is above the yellow square, not to the left of it. therefore, the red sphere cannot be to the left of the blue square,	fully	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
