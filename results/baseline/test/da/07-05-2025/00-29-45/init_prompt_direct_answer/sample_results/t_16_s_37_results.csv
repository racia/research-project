Here are the context sentences:
1. Lily is a lion.
2. Brian is a frog.
3. Julius is a rhino.
4. Julius is white.
5. Greg is a swan.
6. Bernhard is a lion.
7. Bernhard is gray.
8. Brian is white.
9. Greg is white.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	gray	since lily is a lion (context sentence 1), and bernhard is also a lion (context sentence 6), we can infer that they share similar characteristics. bernhard is gray (context sentence 7), so it is logical to assume that lily, being of the same species, is also gray.	fully	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.2	0.6	False	False	False	True	0
