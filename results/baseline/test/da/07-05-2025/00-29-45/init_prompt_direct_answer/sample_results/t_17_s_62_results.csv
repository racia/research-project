Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is to the left of the red square.
2. The triangle is below the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square below the red square?"	no	"from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is to the left of the red square (sentence 1) and the triangle is below the blue square (sentence 2). if the blue square were below the red square, the triangle would be below the red square as well, which contradicts sentence 1. therefore, the blue square must be above the red square, so the answer is ""no"", the blue square is not below the red square."	fully	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
