Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is above the red sphere.
2. The pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere to the right of the triangle?"	no	from context sentence 1, we know that the pink rectangle is above the red sphere, which implies that the pink rectangle and the red sphere are in the same vertical line. from context sentence 2, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle. since the pink rectangle is above the red sphere, the red sphere must also be to the left of the triangle, not to the right. therefore, the answer is no, the red sphere is not to the	fully	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere above the triangle?"	no	from the previous context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is above the red sphere (sentence 1), and the pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle (sentence 2). there is no information provided about the vertical relationship between the red sphere and the triangle. however, since the pink rectangle is above the red sphere, and the pink rectangle is not above the triangle (it's to the left of it), we can infer that the red sphere is not above the triangle	none	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Is the red sphere below the triangle?"	yes	from the previous context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is above the red sphere (sentence 1), and the pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle (sentence 2). since the pink rectangle is above the red sphere, the red sphere must be below the pink rectangle. additionally, the pink rectangle is not above the triangle, which implies that the pink rectangle is at the same level as or below the triangle. therefore, the red sphere, which is below the pink	none	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.4	False	False	False	True	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere below the triangle?"	yes	we already established in a previous question that the red sphere is below the triangle. this conclusion was drawn from the facts that the pink rectangle is above the red sphere (sentence 1) and the pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle (sentence 2), which implies that the pink rectangle is at the same level as or below the triangle, and therefore the red sphere must be below the triangle.	none	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.4	False	False	False	True	0
