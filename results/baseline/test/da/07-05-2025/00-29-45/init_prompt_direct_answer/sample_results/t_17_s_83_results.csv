Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is above the red sphere.
2. The triangle is to the right of the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the left of the triangle?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red square is above the red sphere. from context sentence 2, we know that the triangle is to the right of the red sphere. since the red sphere is below the red square (from sentence 1) and to the left of the triangle (from sentence 2), we can logically conclude that the red square is above and to the left of the triangle, which means the red square is to the left of the triangle.	fully	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square below the triangle?"	no	from the previous context sentences, we know that the red square is above the red sphere (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the right of the red sphere (sentence 2). since the red square is above the red sphere, and the triangle is to the right of the red sphere, it can be logically concluded that the red square is not below the triangle, but rather above it.	none	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.2	0.4	False	False	False	True	0
