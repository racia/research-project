1. The blue square is to the right of the pink rectangle.
2. The blue square is below the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle below the yellow square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the blue square is to the right of the pink rectangle (sentence 1) and the blue square is below the yellow square (sentence 2). since the blue square is below the yellow square, and the pink rectangle is to the left of the blue square, we can logically conclude that the pink rectangle is also below the yellow square.	fully	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square to the left of the pink rectangle?"	no	from the previous context sentences, we know that the blue square is to the right of the pink rectangle (sentence 1) and the blue square is below the yellow square (sentence 2). since the blue square is below the yellow square, it means the yellow square is above the blue square. and since the blue square is to the right of the pink rectangle, the yellow square (which is above the blue square) cannot be to the left of the pink rectangle. therefore,	none	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
