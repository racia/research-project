Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is to the right of the blue square.
2. The red sphere is below the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the right of the blue square?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red sphere is to the right of the blue square. from context sentence 2, we know that the red sphere is below the red square. since the red sphere is to the right of the blue square and below the red square, it can be logically inferred that the red square is also to the right of the blue square, as the red sphere is below it and to the right of the blue square.	fully	yes	True			Answer: yes	0.25	0.5	False	False	False	False	0

Is the red square below the blue square?"	no	from the previous context sentences (1. the red sphere is to the right of the blue square. 2. the red sphere is below the red square.), we know that the red sphere is below the red square. additionally, we previously inferred that the red square is above the red sphere (from the previous question). therefore, it can be logically concluded that the red square is not below the blue square, but rather above the red sphere, which is below the blue square.	none	no	True			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
