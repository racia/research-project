1. Julius is a frog.
2. Lily is a lion.
3. Greg is a frog.
4. Julius is yellow.
5. Bernhard is a rhino.
6. Brian is a lion.
7. Bernhard is yellow.
8. Lily is white.
9. Brian is white.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	yellow	since greg is a frog (sentence 3), and julius is also a frog (sentence 1) and is yellow (sentence 4), it can be logically inferred that greg, being of the same species as julius, is also likely to be yellow. this is the most reasonable assumption based on the provided information, as there is no other color mentioned in relation to frogs.	fully	yellow	True			Answer: yellow	0.0	0.75	False	False	False	False	0
