Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is to the right of the blue square.
2. The red sphere is below the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the right of the red sphere?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is to the right of the blue square (sentence 1), and the red sphere is below the blue square (sentence 2). since the pink rectangle is to the right of the blue square, and the red sphere is below the blue square, it can be logically inferred that the pink rectangle is to the right of the red sphere.	fully	no	False			Answer: no	0.25	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
