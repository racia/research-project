Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the right of the triangle?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 1) and the yellow square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 2). since the yellow square is above the pink rectangle, the pink rectangle must be below the yellow square. if the pink rectangle is below the yellow square and the yellow square is to the left of the triangle, then the pink rectangle cannot be to the right of the triangle. therefore, the answer is no	fully	no	True			Answer: no	0.25	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
