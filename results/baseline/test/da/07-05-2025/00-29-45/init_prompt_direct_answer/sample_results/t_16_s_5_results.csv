Here are the context sentences:
1. Julius is a swan.
2. Julius is gray.
3. Bernhard is a swan.
4. Bernhard is yellow.
5. Brian is a lion.
6. Greg is a lion.
7. Brian is white.
8. Lily is a frog.
9. Lily is gray.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	white	since greg is a lion (sentence 6), and brian is also a lion (sentence 5), we can infer that greg and brian share the same characteristics as they belong to the same species. additionally, sentence 7 states that brian is white. therefore, it is logical to assume that greg, being a lion like brian, also shares the same color, which is white.	fully	white	True			Answer: white	0.25	0.75	False	False	False	False	0
