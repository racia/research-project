Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is below the red square.
2. The triangle is to the left of the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the right of the triangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is below the red square (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the left of the pink rectangle (sentence 2). since the triangle is to the left of the pink rectangle, and the pink rectangle is below the red square, it can be logically inferred that the red square is to the right of the triangle.	fully	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
