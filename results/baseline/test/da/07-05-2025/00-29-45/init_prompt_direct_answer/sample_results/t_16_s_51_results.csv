Here are the context sentences:
1. Greg is a rhino.
2. Bernhard is a swan.
3. Lily is a frog.
4. Lily is green.
5. Julius is a frog.
6. Julius is white.
7. Greg is gray.
8. Brian is a swan.
9. Brian is yellow.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Bernhard?"	yellow	since bernhard is a swan (sentence 2), and brian is also a swan (sentence 8), it can be inferred that bernhard and brian share similar characteristics as they belong to the same species. additionally, sentence 9 states that brian is yellow. therefore, it is logical to assume that bernhard, being a swan like brian, also shares the same color, which is yellow.	fully	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.6	False	False	False	True	0
