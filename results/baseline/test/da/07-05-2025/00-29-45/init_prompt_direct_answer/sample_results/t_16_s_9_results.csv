Here are the context sentences:
1. Lily is a rhino.
2. Greg is a lion.
3. Brian is a lion.
4. Bernhard is a frog.
5. Julius is a swan.
6. Lily is green.
7. Julius is gray.
8. Brian is gray.
9. Bernhard is green.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	gray	since greg is a lion (sentence 2), and brian is also a lion (sentence 3), it can be inferred that greg and brian share similar characteristics. sentence 8 states that brian is gray, so it is logical to assume that greg, being a lion like brian, is also gray.	fully	not mentioned	False			Answer: not mentioned	0.0	0.6	False	False	False	True	0
