Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is to the right of the red sphere.
2. The red square is to the left of the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square to the right of the red sphere?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red square is to the right of the red sphere. from context sentence 2, we know that the blue square is to the right of the red square (since the red square is to the left of the blue square, which implies that the blue square is on the right side of the red square). therefore, we can logically conclude that the blue square is to the right of the red sphere, as it is to the right of	fully	no	False			Answer: no	0.0	0.5	False	False	False	False	0
