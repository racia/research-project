ASK
*
Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences

4
and

5
do
not
provide
any
information
about
Julie
's
location
.
However
,
we
can
refer
back
to
the
previous
context
sentence

1
,
which
mentions
Julie
being
either
in
the
school
or
the
bedroom
.
Since
sentence

5
mentions
Fred
journey
ing
to
the
school
,
it
does
not
provide
any
new
information
about
Julie
's
location
.
Therefore
,
we
can
still
consider
the
possibility
of
Julie
being
in
the
bedroom
.
