8. Fred is in the school.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Fred in the school?"	yes	"the context sentence 8 explicitly states ""fred is in the school"", which directly answers the question ""is fred in the school?"" with a ""yes"". the fact that sentence 7 mentions fred being in the kitchen does not contradict this information, as it is possible for fred to be in multiple locations (although this might be unlikely in a real-world scenario). however, based on the provided information, we can conclude that fred is indeed in the school."	fully	yes	True	Sentence 8 explicitly states that Fred is in the school.

11. Mary went back to the kitchen.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Mary in the kitchen?"	yes	"the context sentence 11 explicitly states ""mary went back to the kitchen"", which implies that mary was previously in the kitchen and has now returned to it. this directly answers the question ""is mary in the kitchen?"" with a ""yes"". the information about julie's location in sentence 10 is irrelevant to mary's location, so it does not affect the conclusion that mary is indeed in the kitchen."	fully	yes	True	Sentence 11 explicitly states that Mary went back to the kitchen, implying that she is now in the kitchen.
