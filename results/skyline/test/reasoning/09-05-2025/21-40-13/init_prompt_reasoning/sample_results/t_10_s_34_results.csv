Now, answer the following question:
Is Fred in the school?"	maybe	from the context sentences, we know that fred is either in the cinema or the school (sentence 1). we also know that julie travelled to the school (sentence 2). however, there is no direct information about fred's current location. since fred could be in either the cinema or the school, and julie's travel to the school does not provide any conclusive evidence about fred's location, we can only conclude that fred might be in the school, but it's not certain,	fully	maybe	True	From sentence 1, we know that Fred is either in the cinema or the school. We don't have any information that confirms Fred's exact location. Sentence 2 informs us that Julie travelled to the school, but it doesn't provide any information about Fred's location.		"assistant
