Here are the context sentences:
1. Bill went to the park.
2. Bill is in the office.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the office?"	yes	"the context sentences provide two separate statements about bill's location. sentence 1 states that bill went to the park, but sentence 2 explicitly states that bill is in the office. since sentence 2 is a more recent and direct statement about bill's current location, it takes precedence over sentence 1. therefore, the correct answer is ""yes"", bill is indeed in the office."	fully	yes	True	"The context sentence 2 explicitly states that ""Bill is in the office"". This contradicts the information in sentence 1, which implies that Bill was in the park at some point. However, sentence 2 provides the most up-to-date information about Bill's location, which is the office."		"assistant

Reasoning: The context sentence 2 explicitly states that ""Bill is in the office"". This contradicts the information in sentence 1, which implies that Bill was in the park at some point. However, sentence 2 provides the most up-to-date information about Bill's location, which is the office.
