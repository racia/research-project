Now, answer the following question:
Is Mary in the bedroom?"	maybe	"the context sentences provide information about mary's and bill's possible locations. sentence 4 states that mary is either in the bedroom or the cinema, but it does not provide a definitive answer to her exact location. since there are two possible locations mentioned, and no additional information is given to favor one over the other, the answer to the question ""is mary in the bedroom?"" is ""maybe"", as it is one of the possible locations mentioned."	fully	maybe	True	Sentence 4 states that Mary is either in the bedroom or the cinema, but it does not provide a definitive location for Mary.
