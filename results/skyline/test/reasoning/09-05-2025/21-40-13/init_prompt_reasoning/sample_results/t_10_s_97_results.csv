Here are the context sentences:
1. Bill went back to the kitchen.
2. Bill is in the office.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the office?"	yes	the context sentences provide two separate statements about bill's location. sentence 1 states that bill went back to the kitchen, but sentence 2 explicitly states that bill is in the office. since sentence 2 is a more recent and direct statement about bill's current location, it takes precedence over sentence 1. therefore, the correct answer is yes, bill is in the office.	fully	yes	True	"The context sentence 2 explicitly states that ""Bill is in the office"". This contradicts the information in sentence 1, which implies that Bill was in the kitchen previously, but sentence 2 provides the current location of Bill, which is the office."		"assistant

Reasoning: The context sentence 2 explicitly states that ""Bill is in the office"". This contradicts the information in sentence 1, which implies that Bill was in the kitchen previously, but sentence 2 provides the current location of Bill, which is the office.
