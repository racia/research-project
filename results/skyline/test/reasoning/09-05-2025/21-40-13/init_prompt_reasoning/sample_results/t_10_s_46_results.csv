Here are the context sentences:
1. Mary journeyed to the office.
2. Bill is either in the school or the kitchen.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the school?"	maybe	"the context sentences do not provide a direct statement about bill's location being specifically in the school. the second sentence only narrows down bill's possible locations to two options: the school or the kitchen. since there is no additional information to confirm or rule out either option, the answer is ""maybe"", indicating uncertainty about bill's presence in the school."	fully	maybe	True	The context sentence 2 states that Bill is either in the school or the kitchen, but it does not provide a definitive location for Bill. Therefore, we can only conclude that Bill might be in the school, but we cannot be certain.

4. Mary journeyed to the cinema.
5. Julie is in the cinema.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Mary in the cinema?"	yes	the context sentence 4 states that mary journeyed to the cinema, which implies that mary's destination was the cinema. it is logical to assume that mary arrived at her destination, and therefore, she is in the cinema. this assumption is further supported by the fact that julie is also in the cinema, as stated in sentence 5, which suggests that the cinema is a valid location where people can be present.	fully	yes	True	The context sentence 4 states that Mary journeyed to the cinema, which implies that Mary has moved to the cinema.

Here are the context sentences:
7. Bill travelled to the cinema.
8. Bill is either in the kitchen or the school.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the cinema?"	no	"sentence 7 states that bill travelled to the cinema, but sentence 8 contradicts this by stating that bill is either in the kitchen or the school, with no mention of the cinema. this implies that bill's travel to the cinema (sentence 7) did not result in him being in the cinema, and instead, he must be in one of the two locations mentioned in sentence 8 (kitchen or school). therefore, the answer is ""no"", bill is not in"	fully	yes	False	The context sentence 7 states that Bill travelled to the cinema, which implies that Bill has moved to the cinema. The context sentence 8 is contradictory, but since Bill travelled to the cinema, we can conclude that Bill is in the cinema.
