Here are the context sentences:
1. Fred moved to the school.
2. Bill is either in the park or the cinema.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the park?"	maybe	"the context sentences do not provide a definitive location for bill, only stating that he is either in the park or the cinema. there is no information that suggests bill is definitely in the park, and there is also no information that suggests he is not in the park. therefore, the most logical answer is ""maybe"", as we cannot determine his exact location with certainty based on the provided information."	fully	maybe	True	The context sentence 2 states that Bill is either in the park or the cinema, but it does not provide a definitive location. Therefore, we can only conclude that Bill might be in the park, but we cannot be certain.

Here are the context sentences:
4. Bill moved to the bedroom.
5. Mary went back to the school.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the park?"	no	the context sentences do not provide any direct information about bill's current location being in the park. in fact, sentence 4 states that bill moved to the bedroom, which implies that bill is currently in the bedroom, not in the park. additionally, sentence 2 from the previous part of the conversation mentioned that bill was either in the park or the cinema, but since then, bill has moved to the bedroom, so it can be inferred that bill is no longer in the park.	fully	no	True	The context sentence 4 states that Bill moved to the bedroom, which means Bill is not in the park. The previous information about Bill being either in the park or the cinema (sentence 2) is no longer relevant.

7. Bill is in the cinema.
8. Julie moved to the office.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the cinema?"	yes	"sentence 7 directly states that bill is in the cinema, which explicitly answers the question. there is no conflicting or contradictory information in the context sentences, and sentence 8 only provides information about julie's location, which does not affect bill's location. therefore, the answer is indeed ""yes"", bill is in the cinema."	fully	yes	True	The context sentence 7 explicitly states that Bill is in the cinema.

Here are the context sentences:
10. Bill is either in the bedroom or the park.
11. Bill moved to the kitchen.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the bedroom?"	no	"sentence 10 provides a possible location for bill, either in the bedroom or the park. however, sentence 11 updates bill's location, stating that bill moved to the kitchen. this implies that bill is no longer in either the bedroom or the park, but has moved to a new location, the kitchen. therefore, the answer is ""no"", bill is not in the bedroom."	fully	no	True	The context sentence 11 states that Bill moved to the kitchen, which means Bill is not in the bedroom.

14. Fred is either in the park or the kitchen.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Bill in the kitchen?"	yes	"the context sentences do not provide any direct information about bill's location. however, we can infer the answer by considering the previous parts of the conversation. in sentence 11, it was stated that bill moved to the kitchen. there is no subsequent information that suggests bill has moved from the kitchen, so it can be logically assumed that bill is still in the kitchen. therefore, the answer is ""yes"", bill is in the kitchen."	none	yes	True	The context sentence 11 (from previous questions) states that Bill moved to the kitchen, and there is no new information that contradicts this.
