Is Bill in the park?"	maybe	"from the first context sentence, we know that bill is either in the park or the cinema. from the second sentence, we know that julie is in the cinema. however, there is no information that explicitly states bill's location. since bill could be in either the park or the cinema, and we only know julie's location, we cannot conclude with certainty whether bill is in the park or not. therefore, the answer is ""maybe""."	fully	maybe	True	From sentence 1, we know Bill is either in the park or the cinema. From sentence 2, we know Julie is in the cinema. Since Julie is in the cinema, it's possible that Bill is not in the cinema, which means he could be in the park. However, we can't be certain.
