Reason
ing
:
The
new
context
sentences
(
6
and

7
)
do
not
provide
any
information
about
Daniel
.
The
previous
information
about
Daniel
is
that
he
grabbed
the
milk
in
the
hallway
(
sentence

3
).
There
is
no
update
about
Daniel
putting
down
or
leaving
the
milk
,
so
it
can
be
inferred
that
Daniel
is
still
carrying
the
milk
.
Answer
:
milk
