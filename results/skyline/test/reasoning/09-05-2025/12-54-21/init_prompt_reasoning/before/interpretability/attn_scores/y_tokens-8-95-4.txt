Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences

10
and

11
are
about
Daniel
,
but
the
question
asks
about
Mary
.
We
need
to
refer
to
the
previous
context
sentences
.
According
to
context
sentence

5
,
Mary
picked
up
the
milk
there
,
which
implies
that
Mary
is
carrying
the
milk
.
The
subsequent
context
sentences
do
not
mention
Mary
putting
down
the
milk
or
picking
up
anything
else
.
Answer
:
milk
