Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences

6
and

7
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
what
Sandra
is
carrying
.
However
,
from
the
previous
context
sentences
,
we
know
that
Sandra
picked
up
the
apple
in
the
bathroom
(
sentence

3
).
There
is
no
information
that
suggests
Sandra
dropped
or
put
down
the
apple
,
so
it
can
be
inferred
that
Sandra
is
still
carrying
the
apple
.
Answer
:
apple
