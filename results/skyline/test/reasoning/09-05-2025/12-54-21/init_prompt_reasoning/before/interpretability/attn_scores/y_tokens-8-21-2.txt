Reason
ing
:
From
the
previous
context
,
we
know
that
Sandra
picked
up
the
apple
in
the
hallway
(
sentence

4
).
Although
Sandra
moved
to
the
office
(
sentence

7
),
there
is
no
information
about
Sandra
dropping
or
leaving
the
apple
.
Therefore
,
it
can
be
inferred
that
Sandra
is
still
carrying
the
apple
.
