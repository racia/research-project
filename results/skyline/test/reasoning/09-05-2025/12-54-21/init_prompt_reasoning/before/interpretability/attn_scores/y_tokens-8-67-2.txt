Reason
ing
:
The
new
context
sentences
(
6
and

7
)
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
Daniel
.
The
previous
information
about
Daniel
is
that
he
grabbed
the
apple
in
the
bathroom
(
sentence

3
).
There
is
no
update
about
Daniel
dropping
or
leaving
the
apple
,
so
we
can
infer
that
Daniel
is
still
carrying
the
apple
.
Answer
:
apple
