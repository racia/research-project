Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
information
about
Daniel
carrying
anything
in
the
kitchen
.
However
,
we
know
from
previous
context
sentences
(
2
)
that
Daniel
got
the
milk
in
the
garden
.
Since
there
is
no
information
about
Daniel
putting
down
the
milk
or
giving
it
to
someone
else
,
we
can
infer
that
Daniel
is
still
carrying
the
milk
.
Answer

milk
