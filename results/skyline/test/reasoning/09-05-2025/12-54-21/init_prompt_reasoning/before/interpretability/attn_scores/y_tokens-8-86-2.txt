ing
:
The
context
sentences

6
and

7
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
what
Mary
is
carrying
.
We
can
refer
back
to
the
previous
context
sentences
,
where
in
sentence

4
,
Mary
grabbed
the
football
in
the
kitchen
.
This
information
is
still
valid
,
as
there
is
no
mention
of
Mary
dropping
or
leaving
the
football
.
Answer
:
football
