ing
:
From
sentence

8
,
we
know
that
Mary
took
the
apple
in
the
office
.
There
is
no
information
about
Mary
putting
down
the
apple
or
giving
it
to
someone
else
.
Although
Mary
moved
to
the
hallway
and
then
to
the
bedroom
,
there
is
no
indication
that
she
dropped
the
apple
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Mary
is
still
carrying
the
apple
.

apple
