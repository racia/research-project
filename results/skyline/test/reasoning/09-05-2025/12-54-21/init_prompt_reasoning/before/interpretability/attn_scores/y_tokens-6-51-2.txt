Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences

4
and

5
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
John
's
location
.
However
,
we
know
from
the
previous
context
sentence

2
that
"
John
moved
to
the
office
",
and
there
is
no
information
that
suggests
John
has
moved
from
the
office
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
John
is
still
in
the
office
.
