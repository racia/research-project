Reason
ing
:
From
the
previous
context
sentences
(
1
and

2
),
we
know
that
Sandra
grabbed
the
milk
there
.
There
is
no
information
about
Sandra
putting
down
or
leaving
the
milk
,
so
we
can
infer
that
she
is
still
carrying
it
.
The
new
context
sentences
(
4
and

5
)
do
not
provide
any
information
that
would
change
this
fact
.
Answer
:
milk
