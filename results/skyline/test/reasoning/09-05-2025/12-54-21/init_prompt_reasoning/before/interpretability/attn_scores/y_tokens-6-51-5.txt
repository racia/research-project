Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences

13
and

14
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
Mary
's
location
.
However
,
we
know
from
the
previous
context
sentence

10
that
"
Mary
travelled
to
the
hallway
",
and
there
is
no
information
that
suggests
Mary
has
moved
from
the
hallway
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Mary
is
still
in
the
hallway
.

yes
