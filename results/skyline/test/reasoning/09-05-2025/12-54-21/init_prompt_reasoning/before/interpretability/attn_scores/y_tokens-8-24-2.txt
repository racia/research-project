Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences

4
and

5
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
what
Sandra
is
carrying
.
We
need
to
refer
back
to
the
previous
context
sentence

1
,
which
states
that
Sandra
picked
up
the
football
there
.
There
is
no
information
that
suggests
Sandra
has
put
down
the
football
or
is
carrying
something
else
.
Answer
:
football
