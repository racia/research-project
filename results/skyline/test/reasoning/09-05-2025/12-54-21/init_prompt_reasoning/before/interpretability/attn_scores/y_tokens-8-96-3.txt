Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences

9
and

10
provide
information
about
Sandra
's
and
John
's
locations
,
but
they
do
not
mention
anything
about
Sandra
putting
down
or
giving
away
the
milk
.
Since
the
last
information
about
the
milk
was
that
Sandra
grabbed
it
(
sentence

7
),
it
can
be
inferred
that
Sandra
is
still
carrying
the
milk
.

:
milk
