Here are the context sentences:
1. Daniel is not in the garden.
2. Sandra moved to the hallway.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Sandra in the bedroom?"	no	since the context sentences only mention daniel being not in the garden and sandra moving to the hallway, there is no information provided about sandra being in the bedroom. the fact that sandra moved to the hallway implies that she is currently in the hallway, not in the bedroom. therefore, the answer is no, sandra is not in the bedroom.	fully	unknown	False	There is no information provided about Sandra's previous location, but we know she moved to the hallway, which implies she was not in the hallway before. There is no mention of the bedroom, so we cannot conclude she was in the bedroom.
