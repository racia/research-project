1. Daniel is in the bathroom.
2. Daniel is not in the bathroom.

Now, answer the following question:
Is Daniel in the bathroom?"	no	"the context sentences provide two contradictory statements about daniel's location. sentence 1 states that daniel is in the bathroom, while sentence 2 states that daniel is not in the bathroom. since both sentences cannot be true at the same time, we need to consider the most recent information. sentence 2 is the latest statement, which explicitly denies daniel's presence in the bathroom. therefore, based on the most recent and direct information, the answer to the question ""is daniel in the bathroom?"""	fully	unknown	False	The context sentences provide contradictory information about Daniel's location.
