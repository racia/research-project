Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
direct
information
about
Bill
going
to
the
kitchen

According
to
sentence

10
,
Bill
travelled
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
,
but
the
question
asks
about
before
the
kitchen
,
which
implies
Bill
's
location
before
going
to
the
kitchen
.
There
is
no
information
about
Bill
's
movement
before
sentence

10
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
where
Bill
was
before
the
kitchen
