Reason
ing
:
From
sentence

2
,
we
know
that
Julie
was
in
the
kitchen
yesterday
.
Since
sentence

1
states
that
Julie
journey
ed
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
,
it
implies
that
Julie
was
somewhere
else
before
coming
to
the
bedroom
.
Given
the
information
,
it
is
logical
to
assume
that
Julie
was
in
the
kitchen
before
the
bedroom
.
Answer
