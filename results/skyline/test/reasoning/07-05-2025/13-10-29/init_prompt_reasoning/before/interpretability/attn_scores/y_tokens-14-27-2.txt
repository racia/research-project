Reason
ing
:
From
the
previous
context
sentences
,
we
know
that
Julie
travelled
to
the
office
this
afternoon
(
sentence

1
)
and
moved
to
the
school
this
morning
(
sentence

2
).
There
is
no
direct
information
about
Julie
's
location
between
the
school
and
the
bedroom
,
but
we
can
infer
that
Julie
was
at
the
office
before
the
bedroom
because
Julie
moved
to
the
school
in
the
morning
and
travelled
to
the
office
in
the
afternoon
,
and
then
moved
to
the
bedroom
in
the
evening
.
