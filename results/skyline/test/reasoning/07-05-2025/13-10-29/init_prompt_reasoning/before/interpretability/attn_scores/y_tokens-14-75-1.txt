Reason
ing
:
According
to
sentence

1
,
Fred
was
at
the
school
this
morning
.
Sentence

4
states
that
Fred
moved
to
the
park
yesterday
,
but
it
doesn
't
count
because
the
question
asks
about
before
the
park
,
which
refers
to
this
afternoon
(
sentence

3
).
So
,
we
need
to
find
where
Fred
was
before
this
afternoon
.
Since
Fred
was
at
the
school
this
morning
,
it
's
logical
to
assume
that
Fred
was
at
the
school
before
the
park
.
Answer
:
school
