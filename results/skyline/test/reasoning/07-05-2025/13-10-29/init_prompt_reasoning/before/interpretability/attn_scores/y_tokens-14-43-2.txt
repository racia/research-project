Reason
ing
:
The
new
context
sentences
(
6
and

7
)
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
Fred
.
We
still
rely
on
the
previous
context
sentences
(
1
-
4
).
From
sentence

1
,
we
know
Fred
went
to
the
cinema
yesterday
.
Then
,
from
sentence

3
,
we
know
Fred
went
back
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
.
The
phrase
"
went
back
"
implies
that
Fred
had
been
to
the
kitchen
before
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Fred
was
at
the
cinema
before
going
back
to
the
kitchen
.
Answer
:
cinema
