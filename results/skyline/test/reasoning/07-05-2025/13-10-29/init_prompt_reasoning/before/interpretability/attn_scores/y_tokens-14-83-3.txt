Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences

9
and

10
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
Fred
's
location
.
We
still
have
the
information
from
previous
sentences
:
Fred
journey
ed
to
the
school
this
morning
(
sentence

1
)
and
Fred
moved
to
the
cinema
yesterday
(
sentence

3
).
However
,
there
is
no
information
about
Fred
's
location
between
the
school
and
the
cinema
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
Fred
's
location
before
the
cinema
.
