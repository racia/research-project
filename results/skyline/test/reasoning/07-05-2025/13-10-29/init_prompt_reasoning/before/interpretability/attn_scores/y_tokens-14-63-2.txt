Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Fred
's
location
before
the
school
,
but
the
provided
context
sentences
(
6
and

7
)
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
Fred
's
location
before
the
school
.
We
should
refer
to
the
previous
context
sentences
(
1
-
4
).
From
context
sentence

4
,
we
know
that
Fred
journey
ed
to
the
park
yesterday
.
There
is
no
other
information
about
Fred
's
location
before
the
school
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Fred
was
at
the
park
before
going
to
the
school
this
morning
.
