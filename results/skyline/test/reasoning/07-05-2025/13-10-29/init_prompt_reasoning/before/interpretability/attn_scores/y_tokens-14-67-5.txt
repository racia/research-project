Reason
ing
:
The
new
context
sentences
(
15
and

16
)
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
Fred
's
movement
before
the
park
.
We
still
rely
on
the
previous
context
sentences
(
9
and

10
).
From
context
sentence

9
,
we
know
that
Fred
travelled
to
the
park
this
evening
.
There
is
no
information
about
Fred
's
movement
before
that
,
but
we
can
infer
that
Fred
was
in
the
school
before
going
to
the
park
because
context
sentence

10
mentions
Fred
's
move
to
the
school
this
afternoon
,
and
context
sentence

9
mentions
Fred
's
travel
to
the
park
this
evening
,
which
is
after
this
afternoon
.
