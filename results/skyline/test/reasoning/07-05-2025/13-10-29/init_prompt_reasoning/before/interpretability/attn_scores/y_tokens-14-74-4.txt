Reason
ing
:
Sentence

11
tells
us
that
Fred
journey
ed
to
the
school
this
morning
,
but
it
doesn
't
mention
where
he
was
before
going
to
the
school
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Fred
was
at
the
park
yesterday
(
from
sentence

7
,
provided
earlier
)
because
sentence

7
mentions
Fred
travelling
to
the
park
yesterday
.
There
is
no
information
about
Fred
's
location
between
yesterday
and
this
morning
,
but
we
can
logically
assume
that
Fred
was
at
the
park
before
going
to
the
school
.
