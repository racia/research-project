Reason
ing
:
Sentence

10
tells
us
that
Fred
went
to
the
cinema
this
afternoon
,
but
it
doesn
't
mention
where
he
was
before
going
to
the
cinema
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Fred
was
at
the
school
this
morning
(
from
sentence

11
,
provided
earlier
)
because
sentence

11
mentions
Fred
journey
ing
to
the
school
this
morning
.
There
is
no
information
about
Fred
's
location
between
this
morning
and
this
afternoon
,
but
we
can
logically
assume
that
Fred
was
at
the
school
before
going
to
the
cinema
.
