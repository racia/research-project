Reason
ing
:
The
new
context
sentences
(
8
and

9
)
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
Julie
's
location
before
the
cinema
.
We
still
rely
on
the
previous
information
from
sentence

4
,
which
states
that
Julie
travelled
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
,
and
sentence

6
,
which
states
that
Julie
moved
to
the
cinema
yesterday
.
This
implies
that
Julie
was
in
the
bedroom
before
going
to
the
cinema
yesterday
.
Answer

bedroom
