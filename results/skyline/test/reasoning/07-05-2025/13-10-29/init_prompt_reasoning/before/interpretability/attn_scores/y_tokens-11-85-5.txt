Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
(
13
-
14
)
are
about
Mary
's
movements
,
but
the
question
asks
about
Sandra
's
location
.
Since
there
is
no
new
information
about
Sandra
's
movements
,
we
need
to
refer
to
the
previous
context
sentences
(
10
-
11
)
which
stated
that
Sandra
went
to
the
garden
.
Answer
:
garden
