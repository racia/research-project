Reason
ing
:
The
question
asks
about
Bill
's
location
before
the
park
,
but
the
provided
context
sentences
(
9
and

10
)
do
not
provide
direct
information
about
Bill
's
location
before
the
park
.
However
,
we
can
look
at
the
previous
context
sentences
.
From
sentence

1
,
we
know
that
Bill
journey
ed
to
the
office
yesterday
.
There
is
no
information
about
Bill
moving
to
a
different
location
after
that
,
until
sentence

7
,
which
states
that
Bill
went
to
the
park
this
morning
.
Therefore
,
it
is
logical
to
assume
that
Bill
was
at
the
office
before
going
to
the
park
.
