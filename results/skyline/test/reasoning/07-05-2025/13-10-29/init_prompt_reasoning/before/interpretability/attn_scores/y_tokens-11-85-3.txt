Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
(
7
-
8
)
are
about
Daniel
's
movements
,
but
the
question
asks
about
John
's
location
.
Since
there
is
no
new
information
about
John
's
movements
,
we
need
to
refer
to
the
previous
context
sentences
(
4
-
5
)
which
stated
that
John
travelled
to
the
bedroom
.
Answer
:
bedroom
