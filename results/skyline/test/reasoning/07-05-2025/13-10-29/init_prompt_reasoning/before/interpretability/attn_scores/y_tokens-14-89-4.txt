Reason
ing
:
The
new
context
sentences
(
12
and

13
)
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
Fred
's
movements
.
We
still
rely
on
the
previous
information
.
From
sentence

1
,
we
know
that
Fred
moved
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
.
Then
,
from
sentence

10
,
we
know
that
Fred
moved
to
the
kitchen
this
afternoon
.
There
is
no
other
information
about
Fred
's
movements
between
these
two
events
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Fred
was
at
the
bedroom
before
moving
to
the
kitchen
.
