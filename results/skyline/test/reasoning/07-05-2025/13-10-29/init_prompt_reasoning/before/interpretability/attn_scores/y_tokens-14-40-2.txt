Reason
ing
:
The
new
context
sentences
do
not
provide
direct
information
about

's
location
before
the
cinema
.
However
,
we
can
refer
to
the
previous
context
sentences
.
According
to
sentence

3
,
"
Yesterday
Bill
went
to
the
school
."
Since
sentence

2
states
,
"
Bill
travelled
to
the
cinema
this
morning
,"
it
can
be
inferred
that
Bill
was
at
the
school
before
going
to
the
cinema
.
