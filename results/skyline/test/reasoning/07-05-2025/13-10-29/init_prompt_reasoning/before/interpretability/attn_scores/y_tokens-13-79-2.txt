Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
only
mention
Mary
and
John
's
movements
,
but
not
Daniel
's
.
The
previous
information
about
Daniel
's
location
was
that
he
was
in
the
garden
(
from
sentences

1
and

2
).
There
is
no
new
information
about
Daniel
's
movements
,
so
his
location
remains
the
same
.
Answer
:
garden
