Reason
ing
:
The
new
context
sentences
(
6
and

7
)
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
Julie
's
location
before
the
kitchen
.
We
still
rely
on
the
previous
context
sentences
(
1
,

2
,

3
,
and

4
).
According
to
sentence

1
,
Julie
was
at
the
school
yesterday
.
Then
,
according
to
sentence

4
,
Julie
travelled
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
.
Therefore
,
Julie
was
at
the
school
before
going
to
the
kitchen
.
Answer
:
school
