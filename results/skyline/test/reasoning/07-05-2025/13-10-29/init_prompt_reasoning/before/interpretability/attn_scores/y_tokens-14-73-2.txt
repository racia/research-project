Reason
ing
:
From
sentence

5
,
we
know
that
Bill
moved
to
the
park
this
afternoon
.
Since
sentence

4
states
that
Bill
journey
ed
to
the
cinema
this
evening
,
it
implies
that
Bill
was
somewhere
else
before
moving
to
the
park
.
There
is
no
direct
information
about
Bill
's
location
before
the
park
,
but
we
can
infer
that
Bill
was
not
in
the
cinema
before
the
park
because
sentence

4
mentions
Bill
going
to
the
cinema
in
the
evening
,
which
is
after
the
afternoon
when
Bill
moved
to
the
park
.
