Reason
ing
:
The
new
context
sentences
(
15
and

16
)
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
Bill
's
location
before
the
bedroom
.
We
still
rely
on
the
previous
context
sentences
(
9
and

10
).
According
to
sentence

10
,
Bill
went
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
.
Then
,
according
to
sentence

9
,
Bill
moved
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
.
Therefore
,
Bill
was
at
the
kitchen
before
going
to
the
bedroom
.
Answer
:
kitchen
