Reason
ing
:
According
to
sentence

7
,
This
afternoon
Mary
moved
to
the
office
.
Since
Mary
moved
to
the
office
in
the
afternoon
,
she
must
have
been
somewhere
else
before
that
.
There
is
no
information
about
Mary
's
location
before
the
afternoon
,
but
sentence

6
mentions
that
Mary
moved
to
the
kitchen
this
evening
,
which
is
after
the
afternoon
.
Therefore
,
Mary
was
not
at
the
kitchen
before
the
office
.
The
only
other
location
mentioned
in
the
context
sentences
is
the
cinema
(
sentence

4
),
but
there
is
no
direct
connection
between
the
cinema
and
the
office
.
