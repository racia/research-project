Reason
ing
:
The
new
context
sentences
(
17
and

18
)
provide
information
about
Fred
's
location
,
but
not
about
Bill
's
location
before
the
kitchen
.
We
still
rely
on
the
previous
information
from
sentence

5
,
which
states
that
Bill
travelled
to
the
bedroom
yesterday
,
and
sentence

15
,
which
states
that
Bill
went
back
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
.
This
implies
that
Bill
was
in
the
bedroom
before
going
to
the
kitchen
.
Answer

bedroom
