Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
direct
information
about
Julie
's
location
before
the
bedroom
.
However
,
we
can
look
at
previous
context
sentences
.
According
to
sentence

3
,
Julie
travelled
to
the
kitchen
this
morning
.
Then
,
there
is
no
information
about
Julie
's
movement
until
sentence

9
,
where
she
went
back
to
the
office
this
evening
.
There
is
no
mention
of
Julie
going
to
the
bedroom
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
where
Julie
was
before
the
bedroom
.
