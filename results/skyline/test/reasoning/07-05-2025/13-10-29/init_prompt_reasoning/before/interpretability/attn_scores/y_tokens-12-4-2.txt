Reason
ing
:
From
sentence

4
,
we
know
that
Mary
and
Sandra
journey
ed
to
the
kitchen
.
There
is
no
subsequent
information
that
suggests
Sandra
moved
to
a
different
location
.
Although
Mary
moved
to
the
garden
with
John
in
sentence

5
,
it
doesn
't
imply
that
Sandra
also
moved
.
Therefore
,
we
can
conclude
that
Sandra
is
still
in
the
kitchen
.
