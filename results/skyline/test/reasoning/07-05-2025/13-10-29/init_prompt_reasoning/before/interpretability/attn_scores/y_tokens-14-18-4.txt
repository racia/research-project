Reason
ing
:
The
new
context
sentences
(
12
and

13
)
do
not
provide
any
additional
information
about
Bill
's
location
before
the
park
.
We
can
still
refer
back
to
the
previous
context
sentences
(
1
-
4
),
which
mentioned
that
Bill
was
at
the
school
yesterday
(
sentence

4
).
Since
sentence

2
stated
,
"
This
morning
Bill
went
to
the
park
,”
it
can
be
inferred
that
Bill
was
at
the
school
before
going
to
the
park
this
morning
.
Answer

school
