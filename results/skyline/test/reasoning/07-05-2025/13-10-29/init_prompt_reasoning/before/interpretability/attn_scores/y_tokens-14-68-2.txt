Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
direct
information
about
Mary
's
location
before
the
bedroom
.
However
,
we
can
look
at
previous
context
sentences
.
According
to
sentence

2
,
Mary
went
back
to
the
cinema
yesterday
.
There
is
no
information
about
Mary
's
movement
after
that
until
sentence

6
,
where
she
went
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Mary
was
at
the
cinema
before
going
to
the
bedroom
.
