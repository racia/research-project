Reason
ing
:
The
new
context
sentences
(
12
and

13
)
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
Fred
's
movement
before
the
cinema
.
We
still
rely
on
the
previous
context
sentences
(
6
and

7
).
From
context
sentence

6
,
we
know
that
Fred
journey
ed
to
the
cinema
this
morning
.
There
is
no
information
about
Fred
's
movement
before
that
,
but
we
can
infer
that
Fred
was
in
the
bedroom
before
going
to
the
cinema
because
context
sentence

2
mentions
Fred
's
move
to
the
bedroom
yesterday
,
and
context
sentence

6
mentions
Fred
's
journey
to
the
cinema
this
morning
,
which
is
after
yesterday
.
