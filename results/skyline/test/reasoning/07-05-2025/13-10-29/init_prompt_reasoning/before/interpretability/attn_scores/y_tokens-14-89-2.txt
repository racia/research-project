Reason
ing
:
There
is
no

However
,
from
sentence

,
we
know
that
Bill
travelled
to
the
school
yesterday

There
is
no
other
information
about
Bill
's
movements
until
sentence

,
where
Bill
journeys
to
the
bedroom
this
morning
.
Therefore
,
we
can
infer
that
Bill
was
at
the
school
before
moving
to
the
bedroom
.
