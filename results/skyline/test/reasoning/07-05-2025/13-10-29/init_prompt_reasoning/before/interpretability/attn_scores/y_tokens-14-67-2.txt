Reason
ing
:
The
new
context
sentences
(
6
and

7
)
do
not
provide
any
new
information
about
Bill
's
movement
.
We
still
rely
on
the
previous
context
sentences
(
1
-
4
).
From
context
sentence

1
,
we
know
that
Bill
moved
to
the
bedroom
yesterday
.
There
is
no
information
about
Bill
's
movement
after
that
until
this
morning
when
he
travelled
to
the
park
(
context
sentence

4
).
Therefore
,
we
can
still
infer
that
Bill
was
in
the
bedroom
before
going
to
the
park
.
