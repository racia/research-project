From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
pink
rectangle
.
There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
relative
positions
of
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
red
sphere
.
However
,
since
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
,
we
can
infer
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
.
Therefore
,
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
.
