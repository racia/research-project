From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
red
square
.
Since
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
red
square
,
it
means
the
red
sphere
is
higher
than
the
red
square
.
If
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
,
it
is
likely
that
the
red
square
(
which
is
below
the
red
sphere
)
is
also
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
.
