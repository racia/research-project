From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
blue
square
.
Since
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
,
and
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
blue
square
,
we
can
logically
conclude
that
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
but
we
can
't
determine
if
it
's
to
the
right
or
not
.
