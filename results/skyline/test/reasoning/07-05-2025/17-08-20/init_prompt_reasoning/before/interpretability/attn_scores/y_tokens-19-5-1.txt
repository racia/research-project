From
sentence

1
,
we
know
the
bedroom
is
east
of
the
bathroom
.

From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
hallway
is
east
of
the
bedroom
,
so
the
bedroom
is
west
of
the
hallway
.

From
sentence

4
,
we
know
the
office
is
south
of
the
bedroom
.

From
sentence

5
,
we
know
the
office
is
north
of
the
kitchen
,
so
the
kitchen
is
south
of
the
office
.

Since
the
office
is
south
of
the
bedroom
,
the
kitchen
must
be
southwest
of
the
bedroom
.

To
go
from
the
bedroom
to
the
kitchen
,
we
need
to
go
south
and
then
west
.
Answer
:
south
,
west
