Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
explicitly
mention
the
color
of
Greg
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Greg
is
a
frog
(
sentence

3
),
and
Julius
is
also
a
frog
(
sentence

1
)
and
is
yellow
(
sentence

4
).
Since
both
Greg
and
Julius
are
frogs
,
it
is
logical
to
assume
that
they
share
similar
characteristics
,
including
color
.
Answer
:
yellow
