From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
pink
rectangle
.
Since
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
pink
rectangle
,
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
yellow
square
.
The
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
,
but
we
can
infer
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
yellow
square
,
which
means
the
pink
rectangle
is
likely
above
the
red
sphere
as
well
.
