Reason
ing
:
From
sentence

1
,
we
know
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
yellow
square
.
This
implies
that
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
red
sphere
.
There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
relative
positions
of
the
yellow
square
and
the
red
square
.
However
,
since
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
yellow
square
,
we
can
infer
that
the
yellow
square
is
not
above
the
red
square
.
