From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
.
Since
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
,
it
means
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
red
sphere
.
Now
,
if
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
red
sphere
,
it
logically
follows
that
the
yellow
square
is
not
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
