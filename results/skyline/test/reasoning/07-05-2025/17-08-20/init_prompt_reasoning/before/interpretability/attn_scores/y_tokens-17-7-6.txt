Reason
ing
:
From
the
context
sentences
,
we
know
that
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

2
),
and
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

1
).
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
yellow
square
,
it
is
logical
to
infer
that
the
red
sphere
is
not
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
