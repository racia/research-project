Reason
ing
:
From
sentence

1
,
we
know
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
However
,
from
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
triangle
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
,
which
means
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
(
since
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
).
Therefore
,
the
pink
rectangle
,
being
below
the
triangle
,
must
be
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
.
