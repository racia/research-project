From
sentence

1
,
we
know
the
triangle
is
below
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
triangle
is
below
the
red
sphere
,
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
triangle
.
Therefore
,
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
,
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
so
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
