From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
.
Therefore
,
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
and
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
which
means
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
So
,
the
red
square
is
not
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
but
rather
the
opposite
.
