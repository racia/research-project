Reason
ing
:
Since
Lily
is
a
sw
an
(
sentence

3
),
and
Bern
hard
is
also
a
sw
an
(
sentence

6
),
we
can
infer
that
Lily
's
color
is
not
mentioned
explicitly
.
However
,
we
know
Bern
hard
's
color
is
white
(
sentence

9
),
but
there
is
no
information
suggesting
Lily
has
the
same
color
as
Bern
hard
.
