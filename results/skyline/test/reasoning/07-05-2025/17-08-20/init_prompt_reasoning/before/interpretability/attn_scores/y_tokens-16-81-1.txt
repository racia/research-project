Reason
ing
:
Since
Greg
is
a
rh
ino
(
sentence

6
),
and
Julius
is
also
a
rh
ino
(
sentence

1
),
we
can
infer
that
Greg
's
color
is
not
mentioned
explicitly
.
However
,
we
know
Julius
's
color
is
yellow
(
sentence

3
).
There
is
no
information
provided
to
suggest
that
all
rh
inos
have
the
same
color
,
so
we
cannot
assume
Greg
's
color
is
yellow
.
