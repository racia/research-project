From
sentence

4
,
we
know
the
office
is
south
of
the
hallway
.
Therefore
,
the
bedroom
is
south
of
the
office
,
and
the
office
is
south
of
the
hallway
,
so
the
bedroom
is
south
-s
outh
of
the
hallway
.
Since
south
-s
outh
is
equivalent
to
north
,
we
need
to
go
north
to
reach
the
hallway
from
the
bedroom
.
Answer
