Reason
ing
:
Since
Brian
is
a
rh
ino
(
sentence

8
),
and
Bern
hard
is
also
a
rh
ino
(
sentence

2
),
we
can
infer
that
Brian
's
color
is
not
mentioned
explicitly
.
However
,
Bern
hard
's
color
is
mentioned
as
yellow
(
sentence

9
).
There
is
no
information
provided
to
suggest
that
all
rh
inos
have
the
same
color
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
assume
Brian
's
color
based
on
Bern
hard
's
color
.
