Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
chest
fits
inside
the
box
(
sentence

2
)
and
the
box
fits
inside
the
suitcase
(
sentence

1
).
This
implies
that
the
chest
is
smaller
than
the
box
,
and
the
box
is
smaller
than
the
suitcase
.
Therefore
,
it
can
be
logically
inferred
that
the
suitcase
does
not
fit
inside
the
chest
.
