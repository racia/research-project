From
sentence

1
,
we
know
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
Since
the
blue
square
is
below
the
red
square
and
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
the
triangle
must
be
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
and
above
the
blue
square
(
since
the
blue
square
is
below
the
red
square
),
therefore
the
triangle
is
not
above
the
red
square
.
