From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
red
square
.
There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
position
of
the
red
square
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
However
,
since
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
red
square
,
it
is
likely
that
the
red
square
is
above
the
red
sphere
.
If
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
then
the
red
square
(
which
is
above
the
red
sphere
)
is
also
likely
to
be
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
.
