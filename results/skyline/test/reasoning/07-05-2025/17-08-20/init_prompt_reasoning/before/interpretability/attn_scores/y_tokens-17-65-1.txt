From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
red
square
.
There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
relative
left
-right
positions
of
the
red
square
and
the
blue
square
.
However
,
since
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
and
below
the
red
square
,
it
is
likely
that
the
red
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
and
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
.
