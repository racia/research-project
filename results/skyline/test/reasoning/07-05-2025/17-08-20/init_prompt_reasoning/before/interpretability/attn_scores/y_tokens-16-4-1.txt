Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
explicitly
mention
the
color
of
Greg
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Greg
's
color
is
not
mentioned
among
the
other
frogs
(
Jul
ius
,
Lily
,
and
Brian
),
and
their
colors
are
green
and
gray
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
Greg
's
color
from
the
given
information
.
