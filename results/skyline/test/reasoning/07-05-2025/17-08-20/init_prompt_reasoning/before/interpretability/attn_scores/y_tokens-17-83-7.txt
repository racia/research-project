ing
:
From
the
previous
context
sentences
,
we
know
the
red
square
is
above
the
red
sphere
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
(
sentence

2
).
There
is
no
information
about
the
triangle
being
below
the
red
square
.
In
fact
,
the
red
square
is
above
the
red
sphere
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
so
the
triangle
cannot
be
below
the
red
square
.
