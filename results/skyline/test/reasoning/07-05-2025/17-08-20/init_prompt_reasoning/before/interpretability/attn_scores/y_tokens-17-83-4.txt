Reason
ing
:
From
the
previous
context
sentences
,
we
know
the
red
square
is
above
the
red
sphere
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
(
sentence

2
).
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
and
the
red
square
is
above
the
red
sphere
,
it
can
be
logically
inferred
that
the
red
square
is
not
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
.
