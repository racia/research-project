Reason
ing
:
Since
Julius
is
a
rh
ino
(
sentence

6
),
and
Greg
is
also
a
rh
ino
(
sentence

4
),
we
can
infer
that
Julius
'
color
is
not
mentioned
explicitly
.
However
,
we
know
that
Greg
is
green
(
sentence

7
),
but
there
is
no
information
suggesting
that
all
rh
inos
have
the
same
color
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
Julius
'
color
based
on
the
given
information
.
