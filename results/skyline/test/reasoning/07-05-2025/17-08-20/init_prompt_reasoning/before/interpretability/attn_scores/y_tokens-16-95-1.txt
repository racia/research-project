Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
explicitly
mention
the
color
of
Greg
.
However
,
we
know
that
Greg
is
a
rh
ino
(
sentence

4
),
and
Julius
is
also
a
rh
ino
(
sentence

2
)
and
is
yellow
(
sentence

8
).
Since
there
is
no
other
information
about
the
color
of
rh
inos
,
we
can
logically
assume
that
Greg
,
being
a
rh
ino
,
might
have
the
same
color
as
Julius
,
which
is
yellow
.
Answer
:
yellow
