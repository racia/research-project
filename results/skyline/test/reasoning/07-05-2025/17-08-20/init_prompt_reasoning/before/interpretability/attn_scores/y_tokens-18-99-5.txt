:

We
already
answered
this
question
before
and
the
answer
is
still
the
same
.

From
sentence

1
,
we
know
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.

From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.

So
,
the
box
and
the
container
are
both
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.

This
implies
that
the
box
and
the
container
have
a
similar
size
or
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
box
.

Since
the
container
is
bigger
than
or
equal
to
the
box
,
it
is
likely
that
the
box
fits
inside
the
container
.
