From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
red
square
is
above
the
yellow
square
.
Since
the
red
square
is
above
the
yellow
square
,
the
yellow
square
must
be
below
the
red
square
.
Therefore
,
the
yellow
square
cannot
be
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
because
the
red
square
is
already
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
