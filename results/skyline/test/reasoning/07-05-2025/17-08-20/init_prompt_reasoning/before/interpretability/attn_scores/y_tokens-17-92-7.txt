ing
:
From
the
previous
context
,
we
know
the
triangle

the
left
of
the
red
square
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
red
square
(
sentence

).
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
red
square
,
the
triangle
cannot
be
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
