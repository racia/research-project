Reason
ing
:
From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
yellow
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
.
There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
triangle
's
position
relative
to
the
pink
rectangle
.
However
,
since
the
yellow
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
and
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
(
from
sentence

1
),
it
is
likely
that
the
triangle
is
below
the
yellow
square
,
and
therefore
also
below
the
pink
rectangle
.
Answer

yes
