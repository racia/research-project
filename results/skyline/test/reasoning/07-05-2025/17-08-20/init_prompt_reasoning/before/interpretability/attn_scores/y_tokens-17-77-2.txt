From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
red
square
is
above
the
yellow
square
.
Since
the
red
square
is
above
the
yellow
square
,
the
yellow
square
must
be
below
the
red
square
.
The
yellow
square
's
position
relative
to
the
triangle
is
not
explicitly
stated
,
but
we
can
infer
that
it
is
likely
to
be
below
the
triangle
as
well
,
given
its
position
relative
to
the
red
square
.
However
,
we
cannot
conclude
that
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
based
on
the
provided
information
.
