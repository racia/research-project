Reason
ing
:
From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
We
also
know
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
red
square
(
sentence

1
).
Since
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
red
square
,
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
,
we
can
logically
conclude
that
the
red
sphere
is
not
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
