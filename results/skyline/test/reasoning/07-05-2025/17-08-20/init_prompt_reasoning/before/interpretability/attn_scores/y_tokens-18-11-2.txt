Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
suitcase
fitting
inside
the
container
.
However
,
we
know
that
the
container
fits
inside
the
box
(
sentence

4
)
and
the
box
fits
inside
the
suitcase
(
sentence

1
).
This
implies
that
the
container
is
smaller
than
the
box
,
and
the
box
is
smaller
than
the
suitcase
.
Therefore
,
it
can
be
logically
inferred
that
the
suitcase
does
not
fit
inside
the
container
.
