Reason
ing
:
From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
There
is
no
information
about
the
relative
positions
of
the
yellow
square
and
the
red
square
.
However
,
since
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
and
the
red
square
is
below
the
red
sphere
(
sentence

1
),
it
is
likely
that
the
yellow
square
is
not
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
.
