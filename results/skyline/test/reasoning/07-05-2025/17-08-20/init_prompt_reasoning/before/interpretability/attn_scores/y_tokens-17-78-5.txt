Reason
ing
:
From
sentence

1
,
we
know
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
.
This
implies
that
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
red
square
(
sentence

2
),
it
is
likely
that
the
yellow
square
is
also
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
