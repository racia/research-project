Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
that
the
chocolate
fits
inside
the
chest
(
sentence

3
)
and
the
chest
fits
inside
the
container
(
sentence

4
),
so
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
chest
.
If
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
chest
and
the
chocolate
fits
inside
the
chest
,
then
the
container
is
also
bigger
than
the
chocolate
.
