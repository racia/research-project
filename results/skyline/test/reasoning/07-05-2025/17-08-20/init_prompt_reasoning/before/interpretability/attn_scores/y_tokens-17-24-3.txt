Reason
ing
:
From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
red
square
is
to
the
left

the
pink
rectangle
.
We
don
't
have
direct
information
about
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
relative
to
the
red
sphere
.
However
,
we
know
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
red
square
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
So
,
the
pink
rectangle
cannot
be
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
