From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
triangle
is
below
the
blue
square
.
We
can
infer
that
the
blue
square
is
above
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
Therefore
,
the
blue
square
must
be
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
So
,
the
blue
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
which
means
the
blue
square
is
not
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
However
,
there
is
no
direct
information
about
the
blue
square
being
exactly
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
.
