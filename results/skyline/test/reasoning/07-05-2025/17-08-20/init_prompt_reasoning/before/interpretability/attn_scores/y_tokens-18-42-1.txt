sentence

3
,

the
box
of
chocolates

we
know
the
chest
fits
inside
the
box
,

box
is
bigger

From
sentence

5
,
we
know
the
suitcase
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
.
There
is
no
direct
comparison
between
the
chocolate
and
the
box
,
but
we
can
infer
that
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
because
the
suitcase
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
and
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
suitcase
(
which
fits
inside
the
box
).
