Reason
ing
:
From
the
context
sentences
,
we
know
that
Lily
is
a
rh
ino
(
sentence

5
),
but
there
is
no
direct
information
about
Lily
's
color
.
However
,
we
have
information
about
the
colors
of
other
rh
inos
:
Bern
hard
is
gray
(
sentence

2
),
Brian
is
white
(
sentence

4
),
and
Julius
is
yellow
(
sentence

9
).
Since
there
is
no
specific
information
about
Lily
's
color
,
we
cannot
determine
it
.
