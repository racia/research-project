From
sentence

1
,
we
know
the
red
square
is
above
the
blue
square
.
Therefore
,
the
yellow
square
must
be
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
and
the
blue
square
is
below
the
red
square
.
So
,
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
and
the
blue
square
is
below
the
red
square
,
which
means
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
.
