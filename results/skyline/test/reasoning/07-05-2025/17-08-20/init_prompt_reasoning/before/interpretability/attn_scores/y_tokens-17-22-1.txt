From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
blue
square
is
below
the
yellow
square
.
Since
the
blue
square
is
below
the
yellow
square
and
to
the
right
of

pink
rectangle
,
the
pink
rectangle
must
be
above
the
blue
square
.
Therefore
,
the
pink
rectangle
is
above
the
yellow
square
,
which
means
it
is
not
below
the
yellow
square
.
