Reason
ing
:
Since
the
chocolate
fits
inside
the
suitcase
(
sentence

5
),
and
there
is
no
direct
information
about
the
chocolate
and
the
container
,
we
need
to
find
a
connection
between
them
.
We
know
that
the
chest
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
(
sent
ences

2
and

4
),
and
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
(
sentence

1
).
Additionally
,
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
box
(
sentence

3
).
Therefore
,
we
can
logically
conclude
that
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
,
which
means
the
chocolate
fits
inside
the
container
.
