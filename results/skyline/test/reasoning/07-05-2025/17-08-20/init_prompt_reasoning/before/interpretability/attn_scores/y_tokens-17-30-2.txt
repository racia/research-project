ing
:
From
sentence

There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
red
sphere

position
relative
to
the
blue
square
.
However
,
from
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
which
implies
the
red
sphere

to
the
right

the
red
square

blue
square
is
above
the
red
square

the
red

cannot
be
below
the
blue
