Reason
ing
:
Since
Brian
is
a
frog
(
sentence

9
),
and
Julius
is
also
a
frog
(
sentence

1
),
we
can
infer
that
Brian
's
color
is
not
mentioned
explicitly
.
However
,
we
know
that
Julius
is
gray
(
sentence

2
),
but
there
is
no
information
that
suggests
all
frogs
have
the
same
color
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
assume
Brian
's
color
based
on
Julius
'.
