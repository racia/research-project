Reason
ing
:

From
the
context
sentences
,
we
know
that
Julius
is
a
lion
(
sentence

9
).
We
also
know
that
Lily
is
a
lion
and
yellow
(
sent
ences

3
and

4
).
However
,
there
is
no
direct
information
about
Julius
'
color
.
We
cannot
assume
that
all
lions
are
yellow
,
as
there
might
be
other
colors
for
lions
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
determine
Julius
'
color
from
the
given
information
.
