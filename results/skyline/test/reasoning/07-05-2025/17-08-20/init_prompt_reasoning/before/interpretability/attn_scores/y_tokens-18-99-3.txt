From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.

So
,
the
box
and
the
container
are
both
bigger

container
have
a
similar
size
or
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
box
.

There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
container
being
bigger
than
the
box
,
but
from
the
given

,
it
is
likely
that
the
container
is
bigger
than
or
equal
