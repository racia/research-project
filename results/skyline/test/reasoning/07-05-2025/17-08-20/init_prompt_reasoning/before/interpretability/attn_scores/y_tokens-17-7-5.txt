Reason
ing
:
From
the
context
sentences
,
we
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

2
).
Although
we
don
't
have
direct
information
about
the
vertical
position
of
the
triangle
relative
to
the
red
sphere
,
we
can
infer
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
yellow
square
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
,
so
it
is
likely
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
triangle
.
