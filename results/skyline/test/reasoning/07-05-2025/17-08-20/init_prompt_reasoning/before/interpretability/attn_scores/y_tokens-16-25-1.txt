Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
explicitly
mention
the
color
of
Julius
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Julius
is
a
frog
(
sentence

9
),
and
another
frog
,
Bern
hard
,
is
green
(
sentence

5
).
Although
this
is
not
a
definitive
connection
,
it
is
a
logical
assumption
to
make
,
given
the
similarity
in
species
.
Answer
:
green
