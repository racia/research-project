Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
explicitly
mention
the
color
of
Greg
.
However
,
we
know
that
Greg
is
a
frog
,
and
we
have
information
about
the
colors
of
other
frogs
(
L
ily
is
green
).
There
is
no
information
that
suggests
Greg
's
color
is
different
from
Lily
's
,
so
we
can
make
a
logical
assumption
that
Greg
's
color
is
not
specified
.
