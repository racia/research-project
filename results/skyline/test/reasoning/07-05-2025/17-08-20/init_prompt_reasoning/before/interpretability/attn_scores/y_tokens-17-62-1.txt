From
sentence

square
.
From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
triangle
is
below
the
blue
square
.
There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
relative
positions
of
the
blue
square
and
the
red
square
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
blue
square
is
above
the
triangle
(
since
the
triangle
is
below
the
blue
square
),
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
Therefore
,
the
blue
square
cannot
be
below
the
red
square
.
