Reason
ing
:
From
the
context
sentences
,
we
know
that
Julius
is
a
lion
(
sentence

3
).
However
,
there
is
no
direct
mention
of
Julius
'
color
.
We
can
observe
that
all
the
other
animals
mentioned
(
Brian
,
Bern
hard
,
Lily
,
and
Greg
)
are
white
,
but
there
is
no
logical
connection
to
assume
Julius
is
also
white
.
