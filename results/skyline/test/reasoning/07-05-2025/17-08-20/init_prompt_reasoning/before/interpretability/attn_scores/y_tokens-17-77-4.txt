From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
red
square
is
above
the
yellow
square
.
Since
the
red
square
is
above
the
yellow
square
,
the
yellow
square
must
be
below
the
red
square
.
Given
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
it
is
likely
that
the
yellow
square
is
also
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
but
we
cannot
conclude
this
with
certainty
.
