Reason
ing
:
Although
we
can
't
find
a
direct
statement
about
the
chocolate
fitting
in
the
chest
,
we
know
from
context
sentence

1
that
"
The
chest
is
bigger
than
the
chocolate
."
This
implies
that
the
chest
has
enough
space
to
hold
the
chocolate
.
Additionally
,
from
context
sentence

5
,
"
The
container
fits
inside
the
chest
,"
and
context
sentence

2
,
"
The
chocolate
fits
inside
the
container
."
We
can
logically
conclude
that
the
chocolate
,
which
fits
inside
the
container
,
also
fits
inside
the
chest
.
