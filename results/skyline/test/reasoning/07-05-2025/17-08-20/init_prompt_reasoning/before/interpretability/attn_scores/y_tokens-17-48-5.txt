From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
triangle
is

square

There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
relative
vertical
positions
of
the
blue
square
and
the
red
sphere
.
However
,
since
the
triangle
is
above
the
blue
square
and
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
it
is
likely
that
the
red
sphere
is
not
above
the
blue
square
.
