Reason
ing
:
We
don
't
have
any
information
that
suggests
the
triangle
is
above
the
blue
square
.
In
fact
,
we
know
that
the
yellow
square
is
above
the
blue
square
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
(
sentence

2
).
This
implies
that
the
triangle
is
likely
to
be
at
the
same
level
or
below
the
blue
square
,
but
we
can
't
conclude
that
it
's
above
the
blue
square
.
