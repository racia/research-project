Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
provide
a
direct
statement
about
Julius
'
color
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Julius
is
not
white
because
Brian
is
a
frog
and
is
white
,
and
Julius
is
also
a
frog
(
sentence

6
).
If
Julius
were
also
white
,
it
would
likely
be
mentioned
.
Therefore
,
we
can
conclude
that
Julius
is
not
white
.
