Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
provide
any
direct
information
about
the
box
fitting
inside
the
chocolate
.
However
,
we
know
that
the
chocolate
fits
inside
the
box
of
chocolates
(
sentence

4
),
and
the
box
of
chocolates
fits
inside
the
box
(
sentence

1
).
This
implies
that
the
chocolate
is
smaller
than
the
box
,
so
the
box
cannot
fit
inside
the
chocolate
.
Answer

no
