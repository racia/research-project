Reason
ing
:
From
the
previous
context
,
we
know
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
and
the
triangle
is
above
the
red
square
.
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
and
the
triangle
is
above
the
red
square
,
we
can
infer
that
the
triangle
is
not
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
