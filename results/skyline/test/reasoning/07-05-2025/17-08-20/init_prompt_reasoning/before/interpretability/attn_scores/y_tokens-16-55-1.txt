Reason
ing
:
Since
Brian
is
a
rh
ino
(
sentence

2
),
and
Bern
hard
is
also
a
rh
ino
(
sentence

1
),
we
can
infer
that
Brian
's
color
is
not
mentioned
explicitly
.
However
,
Bern
hard
's
color
is
mentioned
as
green
(
sentence

7
).
There
is
no
logical
connection
between
Bern
hard
's
color
and
Brian
's
color
,
so
we
cannot
assume
Brian
's
color
is
green
.
