Reason
ing
:
From
the
previous
context
,
we
know
that
the
blue
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
.
There
is
no
information
about
the
vertical
relationship
between
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
triangle
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
the
blue
square
is
above
both
the
pink
rectangle
and
the
triangle
,
so
the
pink
rectangle
must
be
below
the
blue
square
and
above
the
triangle
.
