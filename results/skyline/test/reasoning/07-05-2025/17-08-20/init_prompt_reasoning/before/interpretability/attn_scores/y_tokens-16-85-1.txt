Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
provide
direct
information
about
Greg
's
color
.
However
,
we
know
that
Bern
hard
is
a
frog
and
gray
,
and
Greg
is
also
a
frog
.
Since
there
is
no
information
suggesting
that
frogs
can
have
different
colors
,
we
can
logically
assume
that
Greg
,
being
a
frog
,
is
likely
to
have
the
same
color
as
Bern
hard
,
which
is
gray
.
Answer
:
gray
