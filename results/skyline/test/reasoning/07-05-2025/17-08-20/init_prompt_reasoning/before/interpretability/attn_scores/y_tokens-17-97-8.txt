Reason
ing
:
We
already
know
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
(
from
sentence

2
),
and
the
triangle
is
below
the
red
sphere
(
from
sentence

1
).
Therefore
,
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
triangle
and
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
,
so
the
red
square
cannot
be
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
.
