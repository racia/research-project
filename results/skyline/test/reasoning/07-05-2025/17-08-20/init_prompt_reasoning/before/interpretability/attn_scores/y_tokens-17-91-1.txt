Reason
ing
:
From
sentence

2
,
we
know
that
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
Since
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
red
square
(
sentence

1
),
it
is
likely
that
the
red
square
and
the
red
sphere
are
in
the
same
vertical
plane
.
If
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
then
the
red
square
,
being
above
the
yellow
square
,
would
be
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
.
