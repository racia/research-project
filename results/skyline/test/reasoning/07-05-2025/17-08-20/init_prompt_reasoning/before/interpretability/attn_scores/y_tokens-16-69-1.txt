Reason
ing
:
Since
Julius
is
a
lion
(
sentence

7
),
and
Lily
is
also
a
lion
(
sentence

1
),
we
can
infer
that
Julius
might
have
a
similar
characteristic
as
Lily
.
Lily
is
white
(
sentence

2
),
but
there
is
no
direct
mention
of
Julius
's
color
.
However
,
we
can
't
assume
Julius
is
white
just
because
Lily
is
.
We
need
more
information
.
