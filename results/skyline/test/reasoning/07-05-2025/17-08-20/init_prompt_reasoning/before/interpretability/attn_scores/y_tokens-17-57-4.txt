From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
blue
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
Therefore
,
the
red
sphere
must
be
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
,
and
the
pink
rectangle
must
be
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
.
So
,
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
and
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
which
means
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
.
Hence
,
it
is
not
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
.
