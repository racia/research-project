Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
(
sentence

2
),
and
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
red
square
(
sentence

1
).
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
and
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
red
square
,
we
can
infer
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
