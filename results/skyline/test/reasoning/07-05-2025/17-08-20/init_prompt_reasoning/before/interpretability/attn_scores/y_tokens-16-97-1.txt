Reason
ing
:
From
the
context
sentences
,
we
know
that
Lily
is
a
lion
(
sentence

8
).
However
,
there
is
no
direct
information
about
Lily
's
color
.
We
can
look
at
the
other
lions
mentioned
,
Bern
hard
,
who
is
gray
(
sentence

5
).
But
there
is
no
logical
connection
to
assume
Lily
has
the
same
color
as
Bern
hard
.
Therefore
,
we
cannot
infer
Lily
's
color
from
the
given
information
.
