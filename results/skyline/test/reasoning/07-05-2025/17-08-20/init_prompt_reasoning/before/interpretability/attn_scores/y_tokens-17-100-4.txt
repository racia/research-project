still
the
same
.
From

From
sentence

1
,
we
know
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
(
since
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
).
Therefore
,
the
pink
rectangle
must
be
at
the
same
level
or
above
the
red
square
.
Since
the
red
square
is
below
the
blue
square
,
the
pink
rectangle
cannot
be
below
the
blue
square
.
