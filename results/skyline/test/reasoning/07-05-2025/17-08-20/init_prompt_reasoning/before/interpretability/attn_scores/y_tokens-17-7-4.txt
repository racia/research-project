Reason
ing
:
From
the
context
sentences
,
we
know
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

2
).
There
is
no
direct
or
indirect
information
that
suggests
the
triangle
is
above
or
below
the
red
sphere
.
We
can
only
infer
that
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
but
not
its
vertical
position
relative
to
the
red
sphere
.
