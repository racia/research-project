Reason
ing
:
We
know
the
triangle
is
above
the
yellow
square
(
sentence

2
),
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
pink
rectangle
(
sentence

1
).
Therefore
,
the
yellow
square
must
be
below
the
triangle
,
and
the
pink
rectangle
must
be
below
the
triangle
as
well
.
Since
the
yellow
square
is
below
the
triangle
and
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
triangle
,
the
yellow
square
cannot
be
above
the
pink
rectangle
.
