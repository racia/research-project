Reason
ing
:
There
is
no
direct
mention
of
Lily
's
color
in
the
context
sentences
.
However
,
we
can
look
for
indirect
clues
.
Since
Brian
is
a
lion
and
yellow
,
and
Lily
is
also
a
lion
,
we
can
't
assume
Lily
is
yellow
based
on
this
information
alone
.
There
is
no
other
information
provided
about
Lily
's
color
.
