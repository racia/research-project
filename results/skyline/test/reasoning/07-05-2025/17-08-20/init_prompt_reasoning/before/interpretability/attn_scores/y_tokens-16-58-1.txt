<|start_header_id|>

Reason
ing
:
From
the
context
sentences
,
we
know
that
Lily
is
a
rh
ino
and
Lily
is
gray
(
sentence

9
).
Since
Brian
is
also
a
rh
ino
(
sentence

8
),
and
there
is
no
other
information
about
Brian
's
color
,
we
can
infer
that
Brian
is
likely
to
be
gray
,
just
like
Lily
.

gray
