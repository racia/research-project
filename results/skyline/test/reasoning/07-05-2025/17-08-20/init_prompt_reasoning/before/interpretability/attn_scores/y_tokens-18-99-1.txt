Reason
ing
:

From
sentence

1
,
we
know
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.

From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.

So
,
the
box
and
the
container
are
both
bigger
than
the
box
of
chocolates
.

This
implies
that
the
box
and
the
container
have
a
similar
size
or
the
container
is
bigger
than
the
box
.

There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
box
fitting
inside
the
container
,
but
since
the
container
fits
inside
the
chest
(
sentence

4
)
and
the
box
is
bigger
than
the
chest
(
sentence

3
),
it
is
likely
that
the
box
does
not
fit
inside
the
container
.
