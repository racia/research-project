From
sentence

1
,
we
know
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
Since
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
red
square
,
the
red
square
must
be
above
the
red
sphere
.
Therefore
,
the
pink
rectangle
is
not
above
the
red
square
,
as
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
and
below
the
red
square
.
