From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
yellow
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
.
There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
pink
rectangle
's
position
relative
to
the
triangle
.
However
,
since
the
yellow
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
and
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
it
is
likely
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
also
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
,
but
we
cannot
conclude
it
is
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
.
