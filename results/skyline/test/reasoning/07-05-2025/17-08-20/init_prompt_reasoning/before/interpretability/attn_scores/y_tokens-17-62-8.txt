From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
triangle
is
below
the
blue
square
.
We
can
infer
that
the
blue
square
is
above
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
Therefore
,
the
blue
square
must
be
above
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
which
means
the
blue
square
is
not
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
.
Since
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
square
,
and
the
blue
square
is
above
the
triangle
,
the
blue
square
must
be
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
,
which
means
the
red
square
is
not
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
.
