Reason
ing
:
From
the
previous
context
,
we
know
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
and
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
.
Therefore
,
the
red
square
must
be
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
and
the
red
sphere
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
So
,
the
red
square
is
not
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
