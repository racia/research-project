Reason
ing
:
We
know
that
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
(
sentence

2
),
and
the
red
sphere
is
below
the
red
square
(
sentence

1
).
This
implies
that
the
red
square
is
above
the
red
sphere
,
and
since
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
the
red
square
is
also
above
the
pink
rectangle
.
