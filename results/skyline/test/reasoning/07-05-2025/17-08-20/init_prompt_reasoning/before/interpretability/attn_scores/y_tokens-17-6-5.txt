Reason
ing
:
We
already
answered
this
question
earlier
,
and
the

is
still
the
same
.
From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
red
square
is
below
the
yellow
square
.
Since
the
yellow
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
blue
square
(
sentence

1
),
the
blue
square
is
above
the
yellow
square
,
and
therefore
above
the
red
square
.
Answer

yes
