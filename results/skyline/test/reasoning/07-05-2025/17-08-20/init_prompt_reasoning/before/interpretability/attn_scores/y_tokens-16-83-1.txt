Reason
ing
:
The
context
sentences
do
not
explicitly
mention
the
color
of
Greg
.
However
,
we
can
infer
that
Greg
is
not
white
because
sentences

3
,

5
,
and

7
mention
that
Bern
hard
,
Lily
,
and
Brian
are
white
,
respectively
.
Additionally
,
sentence

9
mentions
that
Julius
,
another
rh
ino
,
is
gray
.
Therefore
,
it
is
likely
that
Greg
is
also
not
gray
.
