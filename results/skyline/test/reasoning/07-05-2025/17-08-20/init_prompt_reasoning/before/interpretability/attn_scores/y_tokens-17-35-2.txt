Reason
ing
:
The
blue
square
is
below
the
triangle
(
sentence

1
),
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
(
sentence

2
).
There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
vertical
relationship
between
the
red
sphere
and
the
blue
square
.
However
,
since
the
blue
square
is
below
the
triangle
,
and
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
it
can
be
logically
inferred
that
the
red
sphere
is
above
the
blue
square
.
