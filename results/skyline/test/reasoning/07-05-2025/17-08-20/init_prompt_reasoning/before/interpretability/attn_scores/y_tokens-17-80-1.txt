From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
.
Since
the
triangle
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
,
the
pink
rectangle
must
be
below
the
triangle
.
And
since
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
yellow
square
,
the
yellow
square
must
be
to
the
left
of
the
triangle
.
Therefore
,
the
pink
rectangle
,
which
is
below
the
triangle
,
must
also
be
below
the
yellow
square
.
