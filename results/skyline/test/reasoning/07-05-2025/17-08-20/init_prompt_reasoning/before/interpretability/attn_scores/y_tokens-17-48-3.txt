From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
triangle
is
above
the
blue
square
.
There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
relative
vertical
positions
of
the
blue
square
and
the
red
sphere
.
However
,
since
the
triangle
is
above
the
blue
square
and
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
,
it
is
likely
that
the
blue
square
is
below
the
triangle
,
but
we
can
't
determine
its
vertical
position
relative
to
the
red
sphere
.
