From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
triangle
is
above
the
blue
square
.
There
is
no
direct
information
about
the
relative
positions
of
the
blue
square
and
the
red
sphere
.
However
,
since
the
triangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
red
sphere
and
above
the
blue
square
,
it
is
likely
that
the
blue
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
red
sphere
,
not
to
the
right
.
