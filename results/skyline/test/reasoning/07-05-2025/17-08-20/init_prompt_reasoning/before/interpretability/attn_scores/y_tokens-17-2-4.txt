Reason
ing
:
From
sentence

2
,
we
know
that
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
We
also
know
that
the
red
square
is
below
the
blue
square
(
sentence

1
).
Therefore
,
the
blue
square
must
be
to
the
right
of
the
red
square
,
and
the
red
square
is
to
the
left
of
the
pink
rectangle
.
So
,
the
pink
rectangle
must
be
to
the
right
of
the
blue
square
,
not
to
the
left
.
