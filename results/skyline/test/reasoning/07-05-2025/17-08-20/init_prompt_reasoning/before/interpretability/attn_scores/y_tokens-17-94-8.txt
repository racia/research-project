Reason
ing
:
We
already
answered
a
similar
question
in
the
previous
parts
,
and
the
answer
remains
the
same
.
The
reasoning
is
also
the
same
:
From
sentence

2
,
we
know
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
.
From
sentence

1
,
we
know
the
pink
rectangle
is
below
the
yellow
square
,
which
means
the
yellow
square
is
above
the
pink
rectangle
.
Since
the
pink
rectangle
is
to
the
right
of
the
triangle
and
below
the
yellow
square
,
it
is
logical
to
conclude
that
the
triangle
is
to
the
left
of
the
yellow
square
,
not
to
the
right
.

no
