Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is below the red square.
2. The triangle is to the left of the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle below the triangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is below the red square (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the left of the red square (sentence 2). since the pink rectangle is below the red square, and the triangle is to the left of the red square, it can be logically inferred that the pink rectangle is also below the triangle. therefore, the answer is yes, the pink rectangle is below the triangle.	fully	unknown	False	From sentence 1, we know the pink rectangle is below the red square. From sentence 2, we know the triangle is to the left of the red square. There is no direct information about the position of the pink rectangle relative to the triangle. However, since the pink rectangle is below the red square and the triangle is to the left of the red square, we cannot conclude that the pink rectangle is below the triangle.		"Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the pink rectangle is below the red square. From sentence 2, we know the triangle is to the left of the red square.
