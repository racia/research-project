Here are the context sentences:
1. Greg is a rhino.
2. Greg is green.
3. Lily is a frog.
4. Julius is a rhino.
5. Brian is a rhino.
6. Brian is green.
7. Lily is yellow.
8. Julius is green.
9. Bernhard is a rhino.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Bernhard?"	green	since bernhard is a rhino (sentence 9), and we know that three other rhinos (greg, brian, and julius) are all green (sentences 2, 6, and 8), it is logical to assume that bernhard, also being a rhino, is likely to be green as well. there is no information provided that would suggest bernhard is a different color, so the most reasonable conclusion is that bernhard is green.	fully	not mentioned	False	Since Bernhard is a rhino (sentence 9), and we know that some rhinos are green (sentences 2, 6, and 8), but we don't have any specific information about Bernhard's color, we can't determine it.		"Reasoning: Since Bernhard is a rhino (sentence 9), and we know that some rhinos are green (sentences 2, 6, and 8), but we don't have any specific information about Bernhard's color, we can't determine it.

Answer: not mentioned"	0.1452	0.0484	False	False	False	True	0
