Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is to the left of the red sphere.
2. The red sphere is above the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square above the yellow square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the red square is to the left of the red sphere (sentence 1), and the red sphere is above the yellow square (sentence 2). since the red sphere is above the yellow square, and the red square is to the left of the red sphere, we can logically conclude that the red square is also above the yellow square.	fully	no	False	From sentence 1, we know the red square is to the left of the red sphere. From sentence 2, we know the red sphere is above the yellow square. There is no information that suggests the red square is above the yellow square. In fact, the red sphere is between them, and the red square is to the left of the red sphere.		"assistant
