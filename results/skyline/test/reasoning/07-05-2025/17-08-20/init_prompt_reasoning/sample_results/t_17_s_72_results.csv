2. The yellow square is below the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square to the right of the triangle?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the yellow square is to the right of the triangle. from context sentence 2, we know that the blue square is above the yellow square. since the yellow square is to the right of the triangle, and the blue square is above the yellow square, we can logically conclude that the blue square is also to the right of the triangle.	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the yellow square is to the right of the triangle. From sentence 2, we know the yellow square is below the blue square. Since the yellow square is below the blue square, the blue square must be above the yellow square.
