1. The container is bigger than the box of chocolates.
2. The chest is bigger than the chocolate.
3. The container is bigger than the box of chocolates.
4. The box is bigger than the container.
5. The box is bigger than the container.

Now, answer the following question:
Does the box of chocolates fit in the box?"	yes	from sentences 1 and 3, we know that the container is bigger than the box of chocolates. however, sentences 4 and 5 contradict this statement, saying that the box is bigger than the container. this means that the box is actually bigger than the container. since the box of chocolates is smaller than the container (from sentences 1 and 3), it must fit inside the box.	fully	unknown	False	From sentence 1, we know the container is bigger than the box of chocolates.

Reasoning:
