Here are the context sentences:
1. Greg is a rhino.
2. Bernhard is a swan.
3. Lily is a frog.
4. Lily is green.
5. Julius is a frog.
6. Julius is white.
7. Greg is gray.
8. Brian is a swan.
9. Brian is yellow.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Bernhard?"	yellow	since bernhard is a swan (sentence 2), and brian is also a swan (sentence 8), it can be inferred that bernhard and brian share similar characteristics as they belong to the same species. additionally, sentence 9 states that brian is yellow. therefore, it is logical to assume that bernhard, being a swan like brian, also shares the same color, which is yellow.	fully	not mentioned	False	The context sentences do not explicitly mention the color of Bernhard. However, we can infer that Bernhard's color is not mentioned, as we have information about the colors of other animals (Greg, Lily, Julius, and Brian).		"Reasoning: The context sentences do not explicitly mention the color of Bernhard.
