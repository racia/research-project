4. Julius is a rhino.
5. Julius is white.
6. Bernhard is a lion.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Bernhard?"	white	since bernhard is a lion (sentence 6), and brian is also a lion (sentence 1) and is white (sentence 2), it can be logically inferred that bernhard, being a lion like brian, is also white.	fully	white	True	Since Bernhard is a lion (sentence 6), and we know that Brian is a lion and white (sentences 1 and 2), we can infer that Bernhard, being a lion, is likely to have the same color as Brian, which is white.		"Reasoning: Since Bernhard is a lion (sentence 6), and we know that Brian is a lion and white (sentences 1 and 2), we can infer that Bernhard, being a lion, is likely to have the same color as Brian, which is white.
