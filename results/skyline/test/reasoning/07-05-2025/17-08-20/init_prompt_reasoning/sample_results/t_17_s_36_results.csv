Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is to the left of the triangle.
2. The red square is to the right of the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle above the yellow square?"	no	from context sentence 1, we know that the red square is to the left of the triangle. from context sentence 2, we know that the red square is to the right of the yellow square. this implies that the yellow square is to the left of the red square. since the red square is to the left of the triangle, the yellow square must also be to the left of the triangle. there is no information provided about the vertical positions of the triangle and the yellow square	fully	unknown	False	The context sentences only provide information about the left-right relationships between the shapes, but not about their vertical positions. Therefore, we cannot infer the vertical relationships between the triangle and the yellow square.		"Reasoning: The context sentences only provide information about the left-right relationships between the shapes, but not about their vertical positions.
