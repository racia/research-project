Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is below the red square.
2. The triangle is to the left of the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the right of the triangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is below the red square (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the left of the pink rectangle (sentence 2). since the triangle is to the left of the pink rectangle, and the pink rectangle is below the red square, it can be logically inferred that the red square is to the right of the triangle.	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the pink rectangle is below the red square, which means the red square is above the pink rectangle. From sentence 2, we know the triangle is to the left of the pink rectangle. Since the triangle is to the left of the pink rectangle, and the pink rectangle is below the red square, the red square must be to the right of the triangle.
