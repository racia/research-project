Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is above the blue square.
2. The triangle is below the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square below the red square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is above the blue square (sentence 1) and the triangle is below the red square (sentence 2). this means that the blue square is above the triangle and the red square is above the triangle. since the blue square is above the triangle and the red square is above the triangle, we can logically conclude that the blue square is below the red square.	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the triangle is above the blue square, which means the blue square is below the triangle. From sentence 2, we know the triangle is below the red square, which means the red square is above the triangle. Since the blue square is below the triangle and the triangle is below the red square, we can conclude that the blue square is below the red square.		"assistant

Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the triangle is above the blue square, which means the blue square is below the triangle. From sentence 2, we know the triangle is below the red square, which means the red square is above the triangle. Since the blue square is below the triangle and the triangle is below the red square, we can conclude that the blue square is below the red square.
