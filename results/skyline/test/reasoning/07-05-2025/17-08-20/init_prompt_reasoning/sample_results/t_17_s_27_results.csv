2. The red square is below the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere to the right of the red square?"	no	"from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is to the right of the red sphere (sentence 1). we also know that the red square is below the pink rectangle (sentence 2). since the red square is below the pink rectangle, and the pink rectangle is to the right of the red sphere, it can be logically inferred that the red sphere is to the left of the red square. therefore, the answer is ""no"", the red sphere is not to the"	fully	not mentioned	False	There is no mention of a red sphere in the context sentences. The context only mentions a red sphere in sentence 1, but it does not provide any information about its relation to the red square.		"Reasoning:
