Now, answer the following question:
What color is Bernhard?"	green	since bernhard is a lion (sentence 7), and greg is also a lion (sentence 1), we can infer that bernhard might have similar characteristics as greg. we know that greg is green (sentence 3), so it is logical to assume that bernhard, being of the same species, would also be green.	fully	not mentioned	False	Since Bernhard is a lion (sentence 7), and we know that Greg is also a lion (sentence 1) and is green (sentence 3), we can infer that Bernhard might also be green. However, there is no direct mention of Bernhard's color.		"Reasoning: Since Bernhard is a lion (sentence 7), and we know that Greg is also a lion (sentence 1) and is green (sentence 3), we can infer that Bernhard might also be green.
