Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is below the yellow square.
2. The red square is above the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square to the right of the yellow square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the red square is below the yellow square (sentence 1) and above the blue square (sentence 2). this implies that the yellow square is above the red square, and the blue square is below the red square. since the red square is in the middle, the yellow square and the blue square cannot be on the same horizontal level, and therefore, the blue square cannot be to the right of the yellow square.	fully	unknown	False	The context sentences only provide information about the vertical positions of the squares, not their horizontal positions. Therefore, we cannot determine the horizontal relationship between the blue square and the yellow square.		"assistant

Reasoning: The context sentences only provide information about the vertical positions of the squares, not their horizontal positions. Therefore, we cannot determine the horizontal relationship between the blue square and the yellow square.
