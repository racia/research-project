Here are the context sentences:
1. The yellow square is above the triangle.
2. The yellow square is to the left of the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle below the blue square?"	yes	from the first context sentence, we know that the yellow square is above the triangle. this implies that the triangle is below the yellow square. from the second context sentence, we know that the yellow square is to the left of the blue square. since the yellow square is above the triangle, and the yellow square is to the left of the blue square, it can be logically inferred that the triangle is below the blue square.	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the yellow square is above the triangle. From sentence 2, we know the yellow square is to the left of the blue square. Since the yellow square is above the triangle, the triangle must be below the yellow square. And since the yellow square is to the left of the blue square, the triangle must be below the blue square as well.		"Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the yellow square is above the triangle.
