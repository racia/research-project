Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is above the red sphere.
2. The triangle is to the right of the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere to the right of the blue square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is above the red sphere (sentence 1) and the triangle is to the right of the blue square (sentence 2). since the triangle is above the red sphere, the red sphere must be below the triangle. and since the triangle is to the right of the blue square, the red sphere (which is below the triangle) must also be to the right of the blue square. therefore, the answer is yes, the red	fully	unknown	False	From sentence 2, we know the triangle is to the right of the blue square.
