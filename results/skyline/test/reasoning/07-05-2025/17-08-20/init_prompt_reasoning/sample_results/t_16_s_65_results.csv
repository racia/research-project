Here are the context sentences:
1. Bernhard is a rhino.
2. Bernhard is gray.
3. Greg is a frog.
4. Julius is a lion.
5. Julius is white.
6. Lily is a frog.
7. Greg is green.
8. Brian is a rhino.
9. Brian is yellow.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	green	since lily is a frog (sentence 6), and greg is also a frog (sentence 3), we can infer that lily and greg share similar characteristics. we know that greg is green (sentence 7), so it is logical to assume that lily, being a frog like greg, is also green.	fully	not mentioned	False	There is no direct information about Lily's color in the context sentences. However, we can infer that Lily is a frog (sentence 6), and we have information about the colors of other frogs (Greg is green, sentence 7). Since there is no specific information about Lily's color, we cannot determine it.		"Reasoning: There is no direct information about Lily's color in the context sentences.
