Here are the context sentences:
1. Bernhard is a rhino.
2. Brian is a rhino.
3. Lily is a swan.
4. Greg is a swan.
5. Lily is white.
6. Julius is a frog.
7. Bernhard is green.
8. Julius is yellow.
9. Greg is white.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Brian?"	green	since bernhard is a rhino (sentence 1) and brian is also a rhino (sentence 2), we can infer that they share similar characteristics. bernhard is green (sentence 7), so it is logical to assume that brian, being of the same species, is also green.	fully	not mentioned	False	Since Brian is a rhino (sentence 2), and Bernhard is also a rhino (sentence 1), we can infer that Brian's color is not mentioned explicitly. However, Bernhard's color is mentioned as green (sentence 7). There is no logical connection between Bernhard's color and Brian's color, so we cannot assume Brian's color is green.
