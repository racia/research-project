Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is to the right of the yellow square.
2. The yellow square is below the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the right of the red sphere?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the red sphere is to the right of the yellow square (sentence 1), and the yellow square is below the pink rectangle (sentence 2). since the yellow square is below the pink rectangle, it means the pink rectangle is above the yellow square. now, if the pink rectangle is above the yellow square, and the red sphere is to the right of the yellow square, then the pink rectangle cannot be to the right of the red sphere	fully	no	True	From sentence 1, we know the red sphere is to the right of the yellow square. From sentence 2, we know the yellow square is below the pink rectangle. There is no direct information about the relative positions of the pink rectangle and the red sphere. However, since the yellow square is below the pink rectangle and the red sphere is to the right of the yellow square, we can infer that the pink rectangle is above the yellow square, and the red sphere is to the right of the yellow square. Therefore, the pink rectangle is not to the right of the red sphere.		"Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the red sphere is to the right of the yellow square.
