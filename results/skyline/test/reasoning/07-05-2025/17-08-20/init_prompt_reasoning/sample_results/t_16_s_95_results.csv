Here are the context sentences:
1. Brian is a swan.
2. Julius is a rhino.
3. Lily is a frog.
4. Greg is a rhino.
5. Lily is gray.
6. Bernhard is a frog.
7. Bernhard is gray.
8. Julius is yellow.
9. Brian is green.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	yellow	since greg is a rhino (from context sentence 4), and julius is also a rhino (from context sentence 2), we can infer that greg and julius share the same characteristics. additionally, we know that julius is yellow (from context sentence 8). therefore, it is logical to assume that greg, being a rhino like julius, is also yellow.	fully	yellow	True	The context sentences do not explicitly mention the color of Greg. However, we know that Greg is a rhino (sentence 4), and Julius is also a rhino (sentence 2) and is yellow (sentence 8). Since there is no other information about the color of rhinos, we can logically assume that Greg, being a rhino, might have the same color as Julius, which is yellow.		"assistant
