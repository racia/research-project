Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is above the red sphere.
2. The pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere to the right of the triangle?"	no	from context sentence 1, we know that the pink rectangle is above the red sphere, which implies that the pink rectangle and the red sphere are in the same vertical line. from context sentence 2, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle. since the pink rectangle is above the red sphere, the red sphere must also be to the left of the triangle, not to the right. therefore, the answer is no, the red sphere is not to the	fully	no	True	From sentence 1, we know the pink rectangle is above the red sphere, which means the red sphere is below the pink rectangle.
