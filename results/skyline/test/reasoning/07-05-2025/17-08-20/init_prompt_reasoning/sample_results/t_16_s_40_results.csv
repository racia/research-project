Here are the context sentences:
1. Brian is a lion.
2. Greg is a frog.
3. Lily is a swan.
4. Brian is green.
5. Greg is yellow.
6. Bernhard is a swan.
7. Julius is a frog.
8. Julius is green.
9. Bernhard is white.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	white	since lily is a swan (context sentence 3), and bernhard is also a swan (context sentence 6), we can infer that they share similar characteristics. additionally, bernhard is white (context sentence 9). therefore, it is logical to assume that lily, being a swan like bernhard, is also white.	fully	not mentioned	False	Since Lily is a swan (sentence 3), and Bernhard is also a swan (sentence 6), we can infer that Lily's color is not mentioned explicitly. However, we know Bernhard's color is white (sentence 9), but there is no information suggesting Lily has the same color as Bernhard.
