1. The blue square is above the red square.
2. The red square is to the left of the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square to the left of the red sphere?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the blue square is above the red square (sentence 1). we also know that the red square is to the left of the red sphere (sentence 2). since the blue square is above the red square, and the red square is to the left of the red sphere, we can logically conclude that the blue square is also to the left of the red sphere. therefore, the answer is yes, the blue square is to the left of	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the blue square is above the red square.
