Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is to the right of the triangle.
2. The pink rectangle is below the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the left of the pink rectangle?"	yes	from the first context sentence, we know that the red square is to the right of the triangle. from the second context sentence, we know that the pink rectangle is below the red square. since the pink rectangle is below the red square, and the red square is to the right of the triangle, it logically follows that the triangle must be to the left of the pink rectangle.	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the red square is to the right of the triangle. From sentence 2, we know the pink rectangle is below the red square. Since the pink rectangle is below the red square, and the red square is to the right of the triangle, the triangle must be to the left of the pink rectangle.		"Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the red square is to the right of the triangle. From sentence 2, we know the pink rectangle is below the red square. Since the pink rectangle is below the red square, and the red square is to the right of the triangle, the triangle must be to the left of the pink rectangle.
