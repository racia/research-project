Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is to the left of the pink rectangle.
2. The red sphere is below the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square above the pink rectangle?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red sphere is to the left of the pink rectangle. from context sentence 2, we know that the red sphere is below the red square. since the red sphere is below the red square and to the left of the pink rectangle, it can be logically inferred that the red square is above the pink rectangle.	fully	yes	True	From sentence 2, we know the red sphere is below the red square. From sentence 1, we know the red sphere is to the left of the pink rectangle. Since the red sphere is below the red square, the red square must be above the red sphere. Therefore, the red square is also above the pink rectangle, as the red sphere is to the left of the pink rectangle.		"assistant

Reasoning: From sentence 2, we know the red sphere is below the red square. From sentence 1, we know the red sphere is to the left of the pink rectangle. Since the red sphere is below the red square, the red square must be above the red sphere. Therefore, the red square is also above the pink rectangle, as the red sphere is to the left of the pink rectangle.
