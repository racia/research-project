So, the box and the container are both bigger than the box of chocolates. 
This implies that the box and the container have a similar size or the container is bigger than the box. 
There is no direct information about the box fitting inside the container, but since the container fits inside the chest (sentence 4) and the box is bigger than the chest (sentence 3), it is likely that the box does not fit inside the container.
