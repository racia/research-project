Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is to the right of the red sphere.
2. The blue square is to the left of the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere above the red square?"	no	"the context sentences only provide information about the relative positions of the blue square and the red sphere/square in the horizontal direction (left and right). there is no information provided about the vertical direction (above or below). therefore, we cannot conclude that the red sphere is above the red square, and the answer is ""no""."	fully	unknown	False	The context sentences only provide information about the horizontal positions of the objects, but not about their vertical positions. There is no information about the red sphere being above or below the red square.		"Reasoning: The context sentences only provide information about the horizontal positions of the objects, but not about their vertical positions.
