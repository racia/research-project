Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is to the left of the red square.
2. The red sphere is below the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere to the right of the triangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is to the left of the red square (sentence 1). we also know that the red sphere is below the red square (sentence 2). since the red sphere is below the red square, and the triangle is to the left of the red square, it can be logically inferred that the red sphere is to the right of the triangle.	fully	unknown	False	From sentence 1, we know the triangle is to the left of the red square. There is no information about the red sphere's position relative to the triangle. The red sphere is below the red square (sentence 2), but this doesn't provide information about its position relative to the triangle.
