1. The yellow square is above the blue square.
2. The yellow square is to the left of the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square to the left of the triangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is above the blue square (sentence 1), which implies that the blue square is below the yellow square. we also know that the yellow square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 2). since the blue square is below the yellow square, it must also be to the left of the triangle, as the yellow square is blocking its way to the right. therefore, the blue square is indeed to the left of the	fully	yes	True	Since the yellow square is above the blue square (sentence 1), the blue square must be below the yellow square. Additionally, the yellow square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 2). Therefore, the blue square, being below the yellow square, must also be to the left of the triangle.
