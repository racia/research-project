Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is to the left of the red sphere.
2. The blue square is below the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere below the pink rectangle?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the blue square is to the left of the red sphere. from context sentence 2, we know that the blue square is below the pink rectangle. since the blue square is below the pink rectangle and the red sphere is to the right of the blue square (from sentence 1), we can logically conclude that the red sphere is also below the pink rectangle.	fully	unknown	False	From sentence 1, we know the blue square is to the left of the red sphere, which doesn't provide any information about their vertical positions. From sentence 2, we know the blue square is below the pink rectangle. Since the blue square is below the pink rectangle and the red sphere is to the left of the blue square, we can't conclude that the red sphere is below the pink rectangle.		"assistant

Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the blue square is to the left of the red sphere, which doesn't provide any information about their vertical positions. From sentence 2, we know the blue square is below the pink rectangle. Since the blue square is below the pink rectangle and the red sphere is to the left of the blue square, we can't conclude that the red sphere is below the pink rectangle.
