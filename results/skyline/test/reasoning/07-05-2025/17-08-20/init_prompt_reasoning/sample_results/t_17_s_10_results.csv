Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is below the yellow square.
2. The red sphere is below the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square below the red sphere?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the blue square is below the yellow square (sentence 1), and the red sphere is below the blue square (sentence 2). this means that the red sphere is below the blue square, and the blue square is below the yellow square. therefore, the yellow square is above the blue square, and the blue square is above the red sphere. as a result, the yellow square cannot be below the red sphere.	fully	no	True	From sentence 1, we know the blue square is below the yellow square, which means the yellow square is above the blue square. From sentence 2, we know the red sphere is below the blue square, which means the blue square is above the red sphere. Since the yellow square is above the blue square and the blue square is above the red sphere, we can conclude that the yellow square is above the red sphere.		"assistant

Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the blue square is below the yellow square, which means the yellow square is above the blue square.
