Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is to the left of the blue square.
2. The blue square is above the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere below the red square?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red square is to the left of the blue square. from context sentence 2, we know that the blue square is above the red sphere. since the blue square is above the red sphere, and the red square is to the left of the blue square, it can be logically inferred that the red sphere is below the red square.	fully	unknown	False	From sentence 2, we know the blue square is above the red sphere.
