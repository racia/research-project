Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is to the right of the yellow square.
2. The red sphere is above the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square above the yellow square?"	no	from context sentence 1, we know that the red sphere is to the right of the yellow square. from context sentence 2, we know that the red sphere is above the red square. there is no information provided about the relative positions of the yellow square and the red square. therefore, we cannot conclude that the red square is above the yellow square. in fact, since the red sphere is above the red square and to the right of the yellow square, it is more likely	fully	unknown	False	From sentence 2, we know the red sphere is above the red square. There is no information about the relative positions of the red square and the yellow square.		"assistant

Reasoning: From sentence 2, we know the red sphere is above the red square. There is no information about the relative positions of the red square and the yellow square.
