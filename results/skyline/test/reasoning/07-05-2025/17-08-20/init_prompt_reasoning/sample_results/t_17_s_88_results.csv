Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is to the right of the yellow square.
2. The red sphere is above the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square to the right of the pink rectangle?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the red sphere is to the right of the yellow square (sentence 1) and the red sphere is above the pink rectangle (sentence 2). since the red sphere is above the pink rectangle, it means the pink rectangle is below the red sphere. now, if the yellow square were to the right of the pink rectangle, the red sphere would be above and to the right of the pink rectangle, which would mean the yellow square is also	fully	no	True	From sentence 1, we know the red sphere is to the right of the yellow square. From sentence 2, we know the red sphere is above the pink rectangle. Since the red sphere is above the pink rectangle, it means the pink rectangle is below the red sphere.
