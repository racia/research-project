Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is to the right of the pink rectangle.
2. The triangle is above the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the right of the yellow square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is to the right of the pink rectangle (sentence 1) and the triangle is above the yellow square (sentence 2). since the triangle is above the yellow square, it means the yellow square is below the triangle. now, if the triangle is to the right of the pink rectangle, and the yellow square is below the triangle, it logically follows that the pink rectangle cannot be to the right of the yellow square. if it	fully	no	True	From sentence 1, we know the triangle is to the right of the pink rectangle. From sentence 2, we know the triangle is above the yellow square. Since the triangle is above the yellow square, the pink rectangle (which is to the left of the triangle) must be to the left of the yellow square, not to the right.		"assistant

Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the triangle is to the right of the pink rectangle. From sentence 2, we know the triangle is above the yellow square. Since the triangle is above the yellow square, the pink rectangle (which is to the left of the triangle) must be to the left of the yellow square, not to the right.
