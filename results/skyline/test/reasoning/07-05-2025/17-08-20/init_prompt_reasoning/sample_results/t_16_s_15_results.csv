Here are the context sentences:
1. Bernhard is a rhino.
2. Bernhard is gray.
3. Brian is a rhino.
4. Brian is white.
5. Lily is a rhino.
6. Greg is a frog.
7. Greg is green.
8. Julius is a rhino.
9. Julius is yellow.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	yellow	since there is no direct information about lily's color, we need to make an inference. we know that bernhard, brian, and julius are all rhinos, and each of them has a different color (gray, white, and yellow, respectively). there is no pattern or correlation between the names and the colors. therefore, the most logical assumption is that lily, being a rhino, has a color that is not mentioned yet for any other rhino. the only remaining color	fully	not mentioned	False	From the context sentences, we know that Lily is a rhino (sentence 5), but there is no direct information about Lily's color. However, we have information about the colors of other rhinos: Bernhard is gray (sentence 2), Brian is white (sentence 4), and Julius is yellow (sentence 9). Since there is no specific information about Lily's color, we cannot determine it.		"assistant

However, we have information about the colors of other rhinos: Bernhard is gray (sentence 2), Brian is white (sentence 4), and Julius is yellow (sentence 9).
