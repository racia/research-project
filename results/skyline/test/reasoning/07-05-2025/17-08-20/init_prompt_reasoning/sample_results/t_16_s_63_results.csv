4. Brian is a rhino.
5. Lily is yellow.
6. Julius is a lion.
7. Brian is green.
8. Julius is green.
9. Greg is a frog.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	gray	since bernhard is a frog and bernhard is gray, we can infer that frogs are typically gray. greg is also a frog, so it is logical to assume that greg is also gray, as there is no other information provided about greg's color.	fully	not mentioned	False	Since Greg is a frog, and we don't have any specific information about his color, we can't determine his color. Bernhard, who is also a frog, is gray, but that doesn't imply that all frogs are gray.		"Reasoning: Since Greg is a frog, and we don't have any specific information about his color, we can't determine his color. Bernhard, who is also a frog, is gray, but that doesn't imply that all frogs are gray.
