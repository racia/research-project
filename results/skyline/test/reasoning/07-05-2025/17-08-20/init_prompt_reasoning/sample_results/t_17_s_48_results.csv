Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is to the right of the red sphere.
2. The triangle is above the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square to the right of the red sphere?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is to the right of the red sphere (sentence 1) and the triangle is above the blue square (sentence 2). since the triangle is above the blue square, it means the blue square is below the triangle. now, considering the triangle is to the right of the red sphere, we can logically conclude that the blue square, which is below the triangle, must also be to the right of the red sphere. therefore,	fully	no	False	From sentence 1, we know the triangle is to the right of the red sphere. From sentence 2, we know the triangle is above the blue square. There is no direct information about the relative positions of the blue square and the red sphere. However, since the triangle is to the right of the red sphere and above the blue square, it is likely that the blue square is to the left of the red sphere, not to the right.
