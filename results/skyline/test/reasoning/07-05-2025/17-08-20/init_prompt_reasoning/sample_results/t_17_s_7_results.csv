Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is above the yellow square.
2. The triangle is to the left of the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle above the red sphere?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the red sphere is above the yellow square (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the left of the yellow square (sentence 2). there is no information provided about the vertical position of the triangle relative to the red sphere. however, since the triangle is to the left of the yellow square and the red sphere is above the yellow square, it can be logically inferred that the triangle is not above the red sphere. if the triangle were	fully	no	True	The context sentences do not provide any information about the vertical position of the triangle relative to the red sphere.
