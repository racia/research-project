Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is to the right of the triangle.
2. The red square is above the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the right of the pink rectangle?"	no	from context sentence 1, we know that the red square is to the right of the triangle. from context sentence 2, we know that the red square is above the pink rectangle. since the red square is above the pink rectangle, it means the pink rectangle is below the red square. now, if the triangle is to the right of the red square (from sentence 1), and the pink rectangle is below the red square, then the triangle cannot be to the right of	fully	no	True	From sentence 1, we know the red square is to the right of the triangle.
