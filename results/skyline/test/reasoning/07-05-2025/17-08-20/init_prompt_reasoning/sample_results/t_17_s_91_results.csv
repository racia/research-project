1. The yellow square is below the red square.
2. The yellow square is to the left of the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the right of the red sphere?"	no	"from context sentence 2, we know that the yellow square is to the left of the red sphere. since the yellow square is below the red square (context sentence 1), and the yellow square is to the left of the red sphere, it can be logically inferred that the red square is also to the left of the red sphere. therefore, the red square cannot be to the right of the red sphere, which leads to the answer ""no""."	fully	yes	False	From sentence 2, we know that the yellow square is to the left of the red sphere. Since the yellow square is below the red square (sentence 1), it is likely that the red square and the red sphere are in the same vertical plane. If the yellow square is to the left of the red sphere, then the red square, being above the yellow square, would be to the right of the red sphere.		"assistant

Reasoning: From sentence 2, we know that the yellow square is to the left of the red sphere. Since the yellow square is below the red square (sentence 1), it is likely that the red square and the red sphere are in the same vertical plane. If the yellow square is to the left of the red sphere, then the red square, being above the yellow square, would be to the right of the red sphere.
