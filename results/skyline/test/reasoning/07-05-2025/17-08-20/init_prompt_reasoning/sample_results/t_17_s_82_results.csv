Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is below the pink rectangle.
2. The triangle is to the left of the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the right of the red square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is below the pink rectangle (sentence 1) and to the left of the red square (sentence 2). since the triangle is to the left of the red square, it means the red square is to the right of the triangle. now, considering the triangle is below the pink rectangle, the pink rectangle must be above the triangle. therefore, the pink rectangle is also to the left of the red square, not to the right	fully	yes	False	From sentence 2, we know the triangle is to the left of the red square. From sentence 1, we know the triangle is below the pink rectangle. Since the triangle is below the pink rectangle and to the left of the red square, it can be inferred that the pink rectangle is to the right of the red square.		"Reasoning: From sentence 2, we know the triangle is to the left of the red square. From sentence 1, we know the triangle is below the pink rectangle. Since the triangle is below the pink rectangle and to the left of the red square, it can be inferred that the pink rectangle is to the right of the red square.
