1. The red square is to the right of the red sphere.
2. The red sphere is to the right of the yellow square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square to the left of the red square?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red square is to the right of the red sphere. from context sentence 2, we know that the red sphere is to the right of the yellow square. therefore, we can logically conclude that the yellow square is to the left of the red sphere, and since the red square is to the right of the red sphere, the yellow square must be to the left of the red square.	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the red square is to the right of the red sphere.
