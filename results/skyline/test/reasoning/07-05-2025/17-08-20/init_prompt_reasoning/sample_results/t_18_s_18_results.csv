Here are the context sentences:
1. The box is bigger than the chocolate.
2. The chest is bigger than the box of chocolates.
3. The container is bigger than the box.
4. The chest is bigger than the box of chocolates.
5. The chocolate fits inside the suitcase.

Now, answer the following question:
Does the chocolate fit in the container?"	yes	from sentence 1, we know the box is bigger than the chocolate. from sentence 3, we know the container is bigger than the box. therefore, we can logically conclude that the container is also bigger than the chocolate. since the chocolate fits inside the suitcase (sentence 5), and the container is bigger than the box, it is reasonable to assume that the chocolate will fit inside the container as well.	fully	yes	True	Since the chocolate fits inside the suitcase (sentence 5), and there is no direct information about the chocolate and the container, we need to find a connection between them. We know that the chest is bigger than the box of chocolates (sentences 2 and 4), and the box is bigger than the chocolate (sentence 1). Additionally, the container is bigger than the box (sentence 3). Therefore, we can logically conclude that the container is bigger than the chocolate, which means the chocolate fits inside the container.
