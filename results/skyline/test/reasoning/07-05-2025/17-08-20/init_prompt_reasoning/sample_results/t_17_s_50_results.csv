Here are the context sentences:
1. The yellow square is to the left of the triangle.
2. The yellow square is above the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the right of the triangle?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 1) and the yellow square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 2). since the yellow square is above the pink rectangle, the pink rectangle must be below the yellow square. if the pink rectangle is below the yellow square and the yellow square is to the left of the triangle, then the pink rectangle cannot be to the right of the triangle. therefore, the answer is no	fully	no	True	From sentence 1, we know the yellow square is to the left of the triangle. From sentence 2, we know the yellow square is above the pink rectangle. There is no direct information about the pink rectangle's position relative to the triangle. However, since the yellow square is above the pink rectangle and to the left of the triangle, it is likely that the pink rectangle is also to the left of the triangle, but we cannot conclude it is to the right of the triangle.
