Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is to the right of the blue square.
2. The red sphere is below the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the right of the blue square?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red sphere is to the right of the blue square. from context sentence 2, we know that the red sphere is below the red square. since the red sphere is to the right of the blue square and below the red square, it can be logically inferred that the red square is also to the right of the blue square, as the red sphere is below it and to the right of the blue square.	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the red sphere is to the right of the blue square. From sentence 2, we know the red sphere is below the red square. There is no direct information about the position of the red square relative to the blue square. However, since the red sphere is below the red square, it is likely that the red square is above the red sphere. If the red sphere is to the right of the blue square, then the red square (which is above the red sphere) is also likely to be to the right of the blue square.
