Here are the context sentences:
1. Julius is a frog.
2. Julius is gray.
3. Bernhard is a lion.
4. Bernhard is gray.
5. Lily is a swan.
6. Lily is white.
7. Greg is a lion.
8. Greg is gray.
9. Brian is a frog.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Brian?"	gray	since brian is a frog (sentence 9), and julius is also a frog (sentence 1) and is gray (sentence 2), it can be logically inferred that brian, being a frog like julius, is also gray.	fully	not mentioned	False	Since Brian is a frog (sentence 9), and Julius is also a frog (sentence 1), we can infer that Brian's color is not mentioned explicitly. However, we know that Julius is gray (sentence 2), but there is no information that suggests all frogs have the same color. Therefore, we cannot assume Brian's color based on Julius'.		"assistant

Reasoning: Since Brian is a frog (sentence 9), and Julius is also a frog (sentence 1), we can infer that Brian's color is not mentioned explicitly. However, we know that Julius is gray (sentence 2), but there is no information that suggests all frogs have the same color. Therefore, we cannot assume Brian's color based on Julius'.
