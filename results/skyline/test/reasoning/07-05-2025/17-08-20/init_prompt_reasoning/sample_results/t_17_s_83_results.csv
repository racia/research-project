Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is above the red sphere.
2. The triangle is to the right of the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square to the left of the triangle?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red square is above the red sphere. from context sentence 2, we know that the triangle is to the right of the red sphere. since the red sphere is below the red square (from sentence 1) and to the left of the triangle (from sentence 2), we can logically conclude that the red square is above and to the left of the triangle, which means the red square is to the left of the triangle.	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the red square is above the red sphere. From sentence 2, we know the triangle is to the right of the red sphere. Since the triangle is to the right of the red sphere, and the red square is above the red sphere, it can be logically inferred that the red square is to the left of the triangle.
