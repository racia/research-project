Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is to the right of the yellow square.
2. The pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square above the red sphere?"	no	the context sentences provide information about the relative positions of the pink rectangle, yellow square, and red sphere. sentence 1 states that the pink rectangle is to the right of the yellow square, and sentence 2 states that the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere. from these two sentences, we can infer that the yellow square is to the left of the pink rectangle and the red sphere is to the right of the pink rectangle. there is no information provided about the vertical	fully	unknown	False	The context sentences only provide information about the horizontal positions of the objects, but not about their vertical positions.
