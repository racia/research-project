Now, answer the following question:
What color is Bernhard?"	white	since bernhard is a lion (sentence 4), and brian is also a lion (sentence 2), and brian is white (sentence 3), it can be logically inferred that bernhard, being of the same species as brian, shares the same characteristic of being white.	fully	white	True	Since Bernhard is a lion (sentence 4), and we know that Brian is a lion and white (sentences 2 and 3), it is logical to assume that Bernhard, being a lion as well, shares the same color as Brian, which is white.		"Reasoning: Since Bernhard is a lion (sentence 4), and we know that Brian is a lion and white (sentences 2 and 3), it is logical to assume that Bernhard, being a lion as well, shares the same color as Brian, which is white.
