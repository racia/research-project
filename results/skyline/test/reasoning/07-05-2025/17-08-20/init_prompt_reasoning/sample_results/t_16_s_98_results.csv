Here are the context sentences:
1. Greg is a frog.
2. Bernhard is a rhino.
3. Greg is yellow.
4. Lily is a frog.
5. Lily is white.
6. Julius is a frog.
7. Julius is green.
8. Brian is a rhino.
9. Bernhard is yellow.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Brian?"	yellow	since brian is a rhino (sentence 8), and bernhard is also a rhino (sentence 2) and yellow (sentence 9), it can be logically inferred that brian, being a rhino like bernhard, is also yellow.	fully	not mentioned	False	Since Brian is a rhino (sentence 8), and Bernhard is also a rhino (sentence 2), we can infer that Brian's color is not mentioned explicitly. However, Bernhard's color is mentioned as yellow (sentence 9). There is no information provided to suggest that all rhinos have the same color. Therefore, we cannot assume Brian's color based on Bernhard's color.		"assistant

Reasoning: Since Brian is a rhino (sentence 8), and Bernhard is also a rhino (sentence 2), we can infer that Brian's color is not mentioned explicitly. However, Bernhard's color is mentioned as yellow (sentence 9). There is no information provided to suggest that all rhinos have the same color. Therefore, we cannot assume Brian's color based on Bernhard's color.
