Here are the context sentences:
1. The triangle is to the right of the yellow square.
2. The triangle is below the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square below the yellow square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the triangle is to the right of the yellow square (sentence 1) and below the blue square (sentence 2). if the triangle is below the blue square, it means the blue square is above the triangle. since the triangle is to the right of the yellow square, the blue square (which is above the triangle) must be above the yellow square as well. therefore, the blue square is not below the yellow square.	fully	no	True	From sentence 2, we know the triangle is below the blue square. From sentence 1, we know the triangle is to the right of the yellow square. If the blue square were below the yellow square, the triangle would not be below the blue square. Therefore, the blue square must be above the yellow square.		"assistant

Reasoning: From sentence 2, we know the triangle is below the blue square. From sentence 1, we know the triangle is to the right of the yellow square. If the blue square were below the yellow square, the triangle would not be below the blue square. Therefore, the blue square must be above the yellow square.
