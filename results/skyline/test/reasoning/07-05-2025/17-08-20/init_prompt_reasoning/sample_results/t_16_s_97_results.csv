Here are the context sentences:
1. Brian is a frog.
2. Bernhard is a lion.
3. Brian is gray.
4. Julius is a frog.
5. Bernhard is gray.
6. Julius is white.
7. Greg is a frog.
8. Lily is a lion.
9. Greg is yellow.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	gray	since lily is a lion (sentence 8), and bernhard is also a lion (sentence 2), we can infer that lily's color is likely to be similar to bernhard's color. bernhard is gray (sentence 5), so it is logical to assume that lily is also gray.	fully	not mentioned	False	From the context sentences, we know that Lily is a lion (sentence 8). However, there is no direct information about Lily's color. We can look at the other lions mentioned, Bernhard, who is gray (sentence 5). But there is no logical connection to assume Lily has the same color as Bernhard. Therefore, we cannot infer Lily's color from the given information.
