Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is to the left of the triangle.
2. The triangle is above the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the right of the blue square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the blue square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 1), and the triangle is above the pink rectangle (sentence 2). since the triangle is above the pink rectangle, it means the pink rectangle is below the triangle. now, we can infer that the pink rectangle is to the right of the blue square because the blue square is to the left of the triangle, and the triangle is above the pink rectangle. therefore, the pink	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the blue square is to the left of the triangle. There is no direct information about the pink rectangle's position relative to the blue square. However, from sentence 2, we know the triangle is above the pink rectangle, which means the triangle is to the right of the blue square (since the blue square is to the left of the triangle). Therefore, the pink rectangle, being below the triangle, must be to the right of the blue square.		"Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the blue square is to the left of the triangle.
