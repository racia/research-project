Here are the context sentences:
1. Bernhard is a swan.
2. Lily is a swan.
3. Bernhard is yellow.
4. Lily is yellow.
5. Julius is a swan.
6. Julius is green.
7. Brian is a rhino.
8. Brian is yellow.
9. Greg is a rhino.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	yellow	since greg is a rhino (sentence 9), and brian is also a rhino (sentence 7), we can infer that greg and brian share similar characteristics as they belong to the same species. we know that brian is yellow (sentence 8), so it is logical to assume that greg, being a rhino like brian, is also yellow.	fully	not mentioned	False	The context sentences do not provide any information about the color of Greg. The sentences only mention the colors of Bernhard, Lily, Julius, and Brian, but not Greg.		"Reasoning: The context sentences do not provide any information about the color of Greg. The sentences only mention the colors of Bernhard, Lily, Julius, and Brian, but not Greg.
