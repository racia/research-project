4. Lily is a rhino.
5. Lily is yellow.
6. Julius is green.
7. Brian is a frog.
8. Brian is green.
9. Bernhard is a rhino.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Bernhard?"	yellow	since bernhard is a rhino (sentence 9), and lily is also a rhino (sentence 4) and yellow (sentence 5), it can be logically inferred that bernhard, being a rhino like lily, is also yellow.	fully	yellow	True	Since Bernhard is a rhino (sentence 9), and Lily is also a rhino and yellow (sentence 4 and 5), we can infer that Bernhard's color is not specified directly, but it is likely to be yellow as well, following the pattern of rhinos being yellow.		"Reasoning: Since Bernhard is a rhino (sentence 9), and Lily is also a rhino and yellow (sentence 4 and 5), we can infer that Bernhard's color is not specified directly, but it is likely to be yellow as well, following the pattern of rhinos being yellow.
