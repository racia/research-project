Here are the context sentences:
1. Julius is a lion.
2. Bernhard is a frog.
3. Brian is a swan.
4. Brian is green.
5. Lily is a lion.
6. Julius is green.
7. Bernhard is gray.
8. Lily is green.
9. Greg is a frog.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	gray	since greg is a frog (sentence 9), and bernhard is also a frog (sentence 2), we can infer that greg and bernhard share similar characteristics. we know that bernhard is gray (sentence 7), so it is logical to assume that greg, being a frog like bernhard, is also gray.	fully	gray	True	The context sentences do not provide direct information about Greg's color. However, we know that Bernhard is a frog and gray, and Greg is also a frog. Since there is no information suggesting that frogs can have different colors, we can logically assume that Greg, being a frog, is likely to have the same color as Bernhard, which is gray.

Reasoning: The context sentences do not provide direct information about Greg's color. However, we know that Bernhard is a frog and gray, and Greg is also a frog. Since there is no information suggesting that frogs can have different colors, we can logically assume that Greg, being a frog, is likely to have the same color as Bernhard, which is gray.
