Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is below the blue square.
2. The red square is above the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square above the pink rectangle?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the blue square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 1) and the red square is above the blue square (sentence 2). therefore, we can logically conclude that the red square is above the pink rectangle, as it is above the blue square, which in turn is above the pink rectangle.	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the pink rectangle is below the blue square. From sentence 2, we know the red square is above the blue square. Since the blue square is above the pink rectangle and the red square is above the blue square, we can logically conclude that the red square is above the pink rectangle.		"assistant

Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the pink rectangle is below the blue square. From sentence 2, we know the red square is above the blue square. Since the blue square is above the pink rectangle and the red square is above the blue square, we can logically conclude that the red square is above the pink rectangle.
