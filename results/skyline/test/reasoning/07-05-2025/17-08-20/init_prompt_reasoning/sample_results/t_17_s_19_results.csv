Here are the context sentences:
1. The red square is below the red sphere.
2. The red sphere is to the left of the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red square below the pink rectangle?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red square is below the red sphere. from context sentence 2, we know that the red sphere is to the left of the pink rectangle. since the red sphere is above the red square (from sentence 1) and to the left of the pink rectangle (from sentence 2), it can be logically inferred that the red square is also below the pink rectangle.	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the red square is below the red sphere.		"*TASK*

Reasoning: 
From sentence 1, we know the red square is below the red sphere. 
From sentence 2, we know the red sphere is to the left of the pink rectangle. 
Since the red sphere is above the red square (from sentence 1) and to the left of the pink rectangle (from sentence 2), the red square must be below the pink rectangle.
