Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is below the red square.
2. The pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the left of the red square?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the red sphere is below the red square. from context sentence 2, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere. since the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere, and the red sphere is below the red square, we can logically conclude that the pink rectangle is to the left of the red square.	fully	yes	True	Since the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere (sentence 2), and the red sphere is below the red square (sentence 1), we can infer that the pink rectangle is to the left of the red square.
