2. The red square is to the right of the blue square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere below the blue square?"	no	from context sentence 1, we know that the red square is below the red sphere. this implies that the red sphere is above the red square. from context sentence 2, we know that the red square is to the right of the blue square. there is no information provided about the vertical position of the blue square relative to the red sphere. however, since the red sphere is above the red square, and the red square is to the right of the blue square, it can	fully	no	True	From sentence 1, we know the red sphere is above the red square.
