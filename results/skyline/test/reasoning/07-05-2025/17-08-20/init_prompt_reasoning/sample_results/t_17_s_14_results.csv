Here are the context sentences:
1. The red sphere is to the right of the red square.
2. The red sphere is to the left of the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the pink rectangle to the left of the red square?"	no	from context sentence 1, we know that the red sphere is to the right of the red square. from context sentence 2, we know that the red sphere is to the left of the pink rectangle. since the red sphere is to the right of the red square and to the left of the pink rectangle, we can logically conclude that the pink rectangle is to the right of the red square, not to the left. therefore, the answer is no, the pink rectangle is not	fully	yes	False	From sentence 1, we know the red sphere is to the right of the red square. From sentence 2, we know the red sphere is to the left of the pink rectangle. Therefore, the pink rectangle must be to the left of the red sphere, and the red sphere is to the right of the red square. So, the pink rectangle is to the left of the red square.		"Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the red sphere is to the right of the red square. From sentence 2, we know the red sphere is to the left of the pink rectangle. Therefore, the pink rectangle must be to the left of the red sphere, and the red sphere is to the right of the red square. So, the pink rectangle is to the left of the red square.
