Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is to the left of the triangle.
2. The blue square is below the red square.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the right of the red square?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the blue square is to the left of the triangle. from context sentence 2, we know that the blue square is below the red square. since the blue square is below the red square, the triangle must be to the right of the red square, because the blue square is to the left of the triangle. therefore, the answer is yes, the triangle is to the right of the red square.	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the blue square is to the left of the triangle. From sentence 2, we know the blue square is below the red square. Since the blue square is below the red square, the triangle must be to the right of the red square because it is to the right of the blue square.
