Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is below the triangle.
2. The triangle is to the right of the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the blue square to the left of the red sphere?"	no	"from the context sentences, we know that the blue square is below the triangle (sentence 1), and the triangle is to the right of the red sphere (sentence 2). since the triangle is to the right of the red sphere, and the blue square is below the triangle, it means the blue square is also to the right of the red sphere, not to the left. therefore, the answer is ""no"", the blue square is not to the left of the red sphere"	fully	yes	False	Since the triangle is to the right of the red sphere (sentence 2), and the blue square is below the triangle (sentence 1), it can be logically inferred that the blue square is to the left of the red sphere.
