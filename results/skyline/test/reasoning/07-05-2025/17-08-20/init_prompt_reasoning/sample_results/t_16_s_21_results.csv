Here are the context sentences:
1. Greg is a frog.
2. Lily is a lion.
3. Bernhard is a frog.
4. Julius is a swan.
5. Brian is a lion.
6. Brian is yellow.
7. Greg is yellow.
8. Bernhard is yellow.
9. Julius is green.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Lily?"	yellow	since lily is a lion (sentence 2), and brian is also a lion (sentence 5), we can infer that lily and brian share the same characteristics as they belong to the same species. additionally, sentence 6 states that brian is yellow, which implies that lions are typically yellow. therefore, it is logical to assume that lily, being a lion, is also yellow.	fully	not mentioned	False	There is no direct mention of Lily's color in the context sentences. However, we can look for indirect clues. Since Brian is a lion and yellow, and Lily is also a lion, we can't assume Lily is yellow based on this information alone. There is no other information provided about Lily's color.		"assistant
