Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere.
2. The yellow square is above the pink rectangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the yellow square above the red sphere?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere (sentence 1). we also know that the yellow square is above the pink rectangle (sentence 2). since the yellow square is above the pink rectangle, and the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere, we can logically conclude that the yellow square is above the red sphere.	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere. From sentence 2, we know the yellow square is above the pink rectangle. Since the yellow square is above the pink rectangle, and the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere, we can infer that the yellow square is above the red sphere.		"assistant

Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere. From sentence 2, we know the yellow square is above the pink rectangle. Since the yellow square is above the pink rectangle, and the pink rectangle is to the left of the red sphere, we can infer that the yellow square is above the red sphere.
