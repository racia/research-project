Here are the context sentences:
1. The blue square is above the red square.
2. The red square is to the left of the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the right of the blue square?"	yes	from the context sentences, we know that the blue square is above the red square (sentence 1), and the red square is to the left of the triangle (sentence 2). since the blue square is above the red square, and the red square is to the left of the triangle, we can logically conclude that the triangle is to the right of the blue square.	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the blue square is above the red square. From sentence 2, we know the red square is to the left of the triangle.
