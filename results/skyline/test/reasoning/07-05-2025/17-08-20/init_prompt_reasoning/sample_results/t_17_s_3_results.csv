Here are the context sentences:
1. The pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle.
2. The triangle is below the red sphere.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the red sphere above the pink rectangle?"	yes	from context sentence 1, we know that the pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle. from context sentence 2, we know that the triangle is below the red sphere. since the triangle is below the red sphere, and the pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle, it can be logically inferred that the red sphere is above the pink rectangle.	fully	yes	True	From sentence 1, we know the pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle. From sentence 2, we know the triangle is below the red sphere. This implies that the red sphere is above the triangle. Since the triangle is to the right of the pink rectangle, the red sphere must be above the pink rectangle.		"assistant

Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the pink rectangle is to the left of the triangle. From sentence 2, we know the triangle is below the red sphere. This implies that the red sphere is above the triangle. Since the triangle is to the right of the pink rectangle, the red sphere must be above the pink rectangle.
