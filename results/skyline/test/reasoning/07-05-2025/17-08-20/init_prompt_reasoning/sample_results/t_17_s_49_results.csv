Here are the context sentences:
1. The yellow square is to the right of the blue square.
2. The yellow square is to the left of the triangle.

Now, answer the following question:
Is the triangle to the left of the blue square?"	no	from the context sentences, we know that the yellow square is to the right of the blue square (sentence 1) and to the left of the triangle (sentence 2). this means that the yellow square is between the blue square and the triangle. since the yellow square is to the right of the blue square, the triangle must be to the right of the yellow square, which in turn means that the triangle is to the right of the blue square. therefore, the triangle is	fully	yes	False	From sentence 1, we know the yellow square is to the right of the blue square. From sentence 2, we know the yellow square is to the left of the triangle. Therefore, the triangle must be to the left of the blue square.		"Reasoning: From sentence 1, we know the yellow square is to the right of the blue square. From sentence 2, we know the yellow square is to the left of the triangle.
