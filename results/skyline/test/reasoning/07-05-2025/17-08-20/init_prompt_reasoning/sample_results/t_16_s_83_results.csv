Here are the context sentences:
1. Bernhard is a frog.
2. Lily is a frog.
3. Bernhard is white.
4. Brian is a frog.
5. Lily is white.
6. Greg is a rhino.
7. Brian is white.
8. Julius is a rhino.
9. Julius is gray.

Now, answer the following question:
What color is Greg?"	gray	since greg is a rhino (sentence 6), and julius is also a rhino (sentence 8), we can infer that greg and julius share similar characteristics as they belong to the same species. additionally, sentence 9 states that julius is gray. therefore, it is logical to assume that greg, being a rhino like julius, also shares the same color, which is gray.	fully	not mentioned	False	The context sentences do not explicitly mention the color of Greg. However, we can infer that Greg is not white because sentences 3, 5, and 7 mention that Bernhard, Lily, and Brian are white, respectively. Additionally, sentence 9 mentions that Julius, another rhino, is gray. Therefore, it is likely that Greg is also not gray.
