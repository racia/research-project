Reason
ing
:
According
to
sentence

2
,
Cats
are
afraid
of
sheep
.
Jessica
is
a
wolf
(
sentence

3
),
but
there
is
no
information
about
what
wolves
are
afraid
of
.
However
,
sentence

7
states
that
Sheep
are
afraid
of
wolves
,
which
implies
that
wolves
are
not
afraid
of
sheep
.
Since
Jessica
is
a
wolf
,
we
need
to
look
for
other
information
.
There
is
no
information
about
what
wolves
are
afraid
of
,
so
we
cannot
determine
what
Jessica
is
afraid
of
.
