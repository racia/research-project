Reason
ing
:
Since
Ger
tr
ude
is
a
sheep
(
sentence

8
),
and
mice
are
afraid
of
sheep
(
sentence

1
),
it
can
be
inferred
that
Ger
tr
ude
,
being
a
sheep
,
is
not
afraid
of
mice
.
Similarly
,
since
wolves
are
afraid
of
sheep
(
sentence

3
),
Ger
tr
ude
,
being
a
sheep
,
is
not
afraid
of
wolves
.
However
,
there
is
no
information
provided
about
sheep
being
afraid
of
any
other
entity
.
Therefore
,
it
can
be
concluded
that
Ger
tr
ude
,
being
a
sheep
,
is
afraid
of
mice
,
as
mice
are
afraid
of
sheep
(
sentence

1
).
