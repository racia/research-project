You will be given a sequence of context sentences and then asked a question about them.
Please answer the question in one word without articles:
- if a question starts with 'who', answer only a name;
- if with 'what' you should answer an object;
- if with 'where', provide only a location;
- if with 'how many', provide only a number;
- if asked about directions, use only 'left', 'right', 'north', 'south' etc., depending on the context.
