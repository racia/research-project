Here are the context sentences:
1. Sandra grabbed the milk there.
2. Sandra moved to the garden.

Now, answer the following question:
Where is the milk?"	garden	since sandra grabbed the milk in sentence 1, we know she has possession of the milk. then, in sentence 2, sandra moves to the garden. it is logical to assume that she takes the milk with her, as there is no indication that she puts it down or gives it to someone else. therefore, the milk is in the garden with sandra.	fully		False	"The context sentence 1 states that Sandra grabbed the milk ""there"", but it doesn't specify where ""there"" is.

Here are the context sentences:
4. Sandra grabbed the football there.
5. Sandra dropped the milk.

Now, answer the following question:
Where is the milk?"	garden	in sentence 5, sandra dropped the milk, but the location where she dropped it is not specified. however, we can look back at the previous context lines and find that sandra was in the garden (sentence 2). although sentence 4 introduces a new object, the football, it doesn't provide any information about the milk's location. therefore, it is logical to assume that sandra dropped the milk in the same location where she was, which is the garden.	partially		False	The context sentence 5 states that Sandra dropped the milk, but it doesn't specify where she dropped it.

7. Sandra discarded the football.
8. Sandra went to the hallway.

Now, answer the following question:
Where is the milk?"	garden	the context lines 7 and 8 do not provide any new information about the milk's location. however, we can look back at the previous context lines and find that the milk was last mentioned in sentence 5, where sandra dropped the milk. we previously inferred that she dropped it in the garden (sentence 2). there is no new information that would suggest the milk's location has changed, so it is still logical to assume that the milk is in the garden.	none		False	There is no mention of the milk in the given context sentences, and the previous mention of the milk was in context sentence 5, where Sandra dropped it.
